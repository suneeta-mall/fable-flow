## 🎉 Hey Kids! Are You Ready for an Adventure?

Join Cassie and her little brother Caleb on an exciting trip to Cronulla Beach where every question leads to an amazing discovery! You'll learn why trees can't walk (well, most of them!), why balls behave mysteriously in moving cars, and how a scientist named Isaac Newton figured out the secrets of how everything moves. Get ready for bunny hops, skip counting, and mind-blowing experiments that'll make you see the world in a whole new way!

## 🚀 What Will You Discover?

Get ready to explore and learn amazing things:

* You'll discover how gravity keeps you connected to Earth and why it's fun to feel it through bunny hops! You'll learn how to figure out when you'll arrive somewhere using distance, time, and speed (and help calm down impatient little brothers). You'll understand why things look like they're moving backward when YOU'RE the one moving forward, and you'll experiment with how balls fall differently depending on how fast you're going. Best of all, you'll meet Sir Isaac Newton and learn how being curious—just like you—can help you discover amazing things about the world!
