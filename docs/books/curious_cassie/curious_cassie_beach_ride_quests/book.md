## 🎉 Hey Kids! Are You Ready for an Adventure?

Join Cassie on an exciting trip to the beach where everyday moments become science adventures! You'll discover why things fall down, how cars really move, and what makes rainbows appear. Get ready to see the world through curious eyes—just like the famous scientist Isaac Newton!

## 🚀 What Will You Discover?

Get ready to explore and learn amazing things:

* You'll discover why gravity pulls everything down (and why jumping takes work!), how motion looks different depending on where you stand, why things push back when you push them, and how white light secretly contains all the rainbow colors. Most importantly, you'll learn that asking questions and staying curious can help you understand the amazing world around you—just like Isaac Newton did!



## 🎨 Cool Things About This Story:


* Did you know there's a real tree called the Walking Palm that can actually move by growing new roots? Isaac Newton figured out gravity, motion, AND rainbows—all by staying curious and thinking hard! You can do science experiments right in your car by tossing a ball while moving! When you push sand at the beach, the sand is actually pushing you back with the same amount of force!

## 🌈 Adventures We'll Go On:
**Gravity and forces, motion and speed, distance and time, relative motion, Newton's Third Law (action and reaction), light and rainbows, scientific curiosity and observation, asking questions, persistence in learning** - and so much more!
