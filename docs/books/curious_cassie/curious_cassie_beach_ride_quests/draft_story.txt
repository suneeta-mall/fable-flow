# Curious Cassie's Beach Ride Quest
## A Celebration of Isaac Newton's Discoveries

# Chapter 1: Let's Get Moving!

Cassie is a curious six-year-old child. She loves thinking and asking interesting questions. Today her mum is driving Cassie and Cassie's three-year-old brother Caleb to Cronulla Beach for an adventurous day! Sssh... Cassie does not know it yet!

Cassie is playing in the backyard sandpit under the shade of a beautiful yellow wattle tree. The golden flowers hang above her like tiny suns, and bees buzz lazily from bloom to bloom. Cassie is building a sandcastle, carefully patting each tower into shape.

"Let's get moving Cassie! We are going to the beach!" calls Cassie's mum from the back door.

Cassie jumps up with excitement. She loves beaches and sand. Who doesn't, right? But then she pauses. She looks at her sandcastle. She looks at the wattle tree above her. She slowly says the word out loud: "M... O... V... E."

She is thinking! Her eyes begin to sparkle. Curious Cassie has a question!

"Mum," she calls out, "you and I can move. Why can't the trees move?"

"Ooh, that's a brilliant question Cassie!" Mum exclaims, walking over to join her under the wattle tree. Mum looks up at the beautiful tree, its branches stretching wide like arms reaching for the sky.

"You see, sweetheart, this tree has roots," Mum explains, pointing down at the base of the trunk. "Deep, deep under the ground, there are roots spreading out like underground branches. These roots hold the tree firm in the earth. They drink up water and keep the tree steady, even when the wind blows."

Cassie looks down at her own feet. "But I don't have roots!"

"Exactly! We have legs!" Mum says with a grin. She starts shaking her legs in a silly dance and then does a little hop like a bunny. "See! We can lift our legs up and bring them down again. We push against the ground, and that's how we move around!"

Cassie giggles at Mum's bunny hop. She tries one too, feeling her legs push off the ground and land again with a soft thump.

"So trees are stuck because of their roots, and we can move because of our legs?" Cassie asks.

"That's right, my clever girl!"

Cassie is convinced. She goes back to patting her sandcastle, thinking about roots and legs and all the different ways things move. The wind rustles the wattle tree above her, and the branches sway and dance. The tree can't walk away, but it can still dance in the breeze!

Suddenly, Mum's eyes light up. She has remembered something exciting!

"Cassie! Caleb! Come here, I have to tell you something amazing!"

Caleb comes toddling over from where he was digging a hole. His hands are covered in dirt and his smile is wide.

"There is a special type of tree," Mum begins, her voice full of wonder, "that grows in the tropical rainforests far, far away. It's called the Walking Palm. And this tree... can actually MOVE!"

Cassie's eyes go wide. "A WALKING tree?! But you just said trees have roots!"

"It DOES have roots," Mum says mysteriously. "But this clever tree has found a way to move even with roots. Shall I tell you how?"

"YES!" both children shout together.

"Well," Mum begins, settling down on the grass beside them, "this tree loves sunshine. All trees need sunshine, you know. They use sunlight to make their food. We eat sandwiches and apples, but trees? Trees eat sunshine!"

"Trees eat sunshine?" Caleb repeats, amazed.

"In a way, yes! They use the light to make energy. Now, the Walking Palm is very clever. When it notices there's more sunshine in one direction, it starts growing NEW roots on that side—the sunny side."

Cassie is leaning forward, completely fascinated.

"The new roots grow toward the sunshine, reaching out like fingers pointing at the light. Then, very slowly, the tree starts to lean that way. What happens when you lean forward, Caleb?"

Caleb tries leaning forward. "My butt-butt feels stretchy!" he giggles, wobbling.

"Exactly! When the Walking Palm leans toward its new roots, it's like it's bending forward. And guess what happens to the old roots on the other side? The ones that aren't getting sunshine anymore?"

"What?" Cassie whispers.

"They dry up! They let go of the ground! So the tree is now standing on new roots, a little bit forward from where it was before."

"So it took a step!" Cassie exclaims.

"A very, very slow step," Mum laughs. "This process takes YEARS, Cassie. The tree might move only a tiny, tiny bit—maybe as far as you can stretch your fingers—in a whole year! But over many, many years, the Walking Palm can actually travel through the forest, following the sunshine."

"That's AMAZING!" Cassie shouts. She turns to Caleb and grabs his hands. "Caleb! Caleb! Did you know there's a tree that can WALK?!"

Caleb starts stomping around like a tree, moving very slowly, stretching his arms out like branches. "I'm a walking tree! I'm a walking tree!"

Cassie joins him, and they both walk in super slow motion around the backyard, pretending to grow new roots with each step. Mum watches them with a big smile.

"What a fun fact, Mum!" Cassie says when they finally stop their tree-walking. "We love it!"

---

Cassie goes back to her sandpit, but now her mind is buzzing with new thoughts. She picks up her little spade and scoops some sand. She tosses it up in the air, watching the grains sparkle in the sunlight.

Up, up, up goes the sand... and then down, down, down it comes, landing on her shoes and the ground around her.

She tries again. Up, up, up... and down, down, down.

"Hmm," she says to herself.

Just then, she feels something cool on her nose. She looks up. Little droplets are falling from the sky—it's starting to drizzle! The raindrops fall down, down, down, just like the sand.

Cassie watches the rain falling. She watches the sand falling. Everything comes down! But why?

"Mum!" she hollers across the yard. "Why does EVERYTHING come down to the ground? The sand goes up, but it always comes down. The rain comes down. Why doesn't anything just... float?"

Mum walks over, not minding the light drizzle. "Because of gravity, sweetheart."

"Gravity?" Cassie repeats the new word. "What's that?"

"Gravity is like an invisible force," Mum explains, sitting down on the edge of the sandpit. "The ground—the whole Earth, actually—pulls everything toward itself. It's not a strong yank, but a gentle, constant pull. Everything gets pulled down toward the Earth, all the time."

Cassie looks around. "But I can't SEE it!"

"No, you can't see gravity. But you can FEEL it! Let's try something."

Mum stands up and holds out her hands. "Do a bunny jump, as high as you can!"

Cassie bends her knees and pushes off the ground with all her might. She flies up into the air for just a moment—and then lands back down on her feet.

"Did you feel that?" Mum asks.

"Feel what?"

"Okay, let's think about it. When you jumped UP, what did you have to do? Did you have to try hard?"

Cassie thinks. "Yes! I had to squeeze my legs and push really hard to go up!"

"Right! You made an effort. Your legs had to WORK to push you up. Now... what about when you came back down? Did you have to do anything?"

Cassie's forehead wrinkles as she thinks. She does another jump, paying attention this time. Up—she pushes hard. Down—she just... falls.

"I didn't do ANYTHING to come down!" she realizes. "I just... came down!"

"THAT'S gravity!" Mum exclaims. "You didn't have to work to come down because gravity was pulling you. Gravity did all the work for you! It brought your sand down, it brought the rain down, and it brought YOU down."

Cassie's face lights up with understanding. "So gravity is like... the Earth giving me a hug? Pulling me back?"

"What a beautiful way to think about it! Yes, the Earth is always hugging everything, pulling us gently toward it."

Caleb comes bouncing over. "I want Earth hugs!" He starts jumping up and down, up and down.

Cassie joins him. They jump and jump, feeling themselves fly up with effort and fall down with ease. Every landing is gravity catching them, pulling them back to the ground.

"Thank you, gravity!" Cassie calls out. "Thank you for making jumping so much fun!"

She does two more hops, then another two, then another two. She can't stop jumping! Each time she lands, she thinks about the invisible force bringing her back down.

Then she suddenly remembers—they're going to the BEACH!

"Mum! Mum! We were going to the beach! Can we go now? Please?"

Mum laughs. "Yes, my little jumping bean. Let's get moving!"

As they walk toward the car, Cassie starts to sing, marching in time with her steps:

*I am marching up and down,*
*I am moving all around,*
*I am going to the town,*
*Where beaches are abound!*

*I will make some sandy towers,*
*And show my superpowers,*
*I will jump up and down the towers,*
*And scamper about at this hour!*

*I am marching up and down,*
*I am moving all around,*
*I am going to the town,*
*Where beaches abound!*

Caleb tries to march along, his little legs working hard to keep up. The drizzle has stopped, and patches of blue sky are appearing between the clouds. It's going to be a beautiful beach day!

# Chapter 2: Driving to the Beach

Cassie's mum gathers everyone together and buckles Cassie and Caleb safely into the car. She checks their seatbelts—click, click—nice and snug. Then she walks around to the front, climbs in, and turns the key. The engine rumbles to life.

She is just about ready to vroom vroom down the driveway when a little voice pipes up from the back seat.

"Are we there yet?" asks Caleb.

Mum and Cassie look at each other and burst out giggling!

"Caleb!" Cassie laughs. "We haven't even MOVED yet! Look, we're still in our driveway!"

Caleb looks out the window and sees their house, their garden, their letterbox. He grins sheepishly. "Oh."

Mum starts backing out of the driveway, and they're off! But now Curious Cassie has started thinking again. She wants to imagine how far the beach is inside her brain. She wants to picture the journey before they even get there.

"Mum," she asks, "how far do we need to move to get to the beach?"

"It's about 10 kilometres away," Mum replies.

"10 kilometres," Cassie repeats slowly. She scrunches up her face. "What does that even MEAN?"

There's a big question mark floating above her head—well, not really, but that's what it feels like!

"A kilometre is how we measure distance," Mum explains, turning onto the main road. "You know the walk from our house to Aqua Flora Park? The one where we feed the ducks?"

"Yes!" both children say. They love that park!

"Well, the distance from home to Aqua Flora Park is about 1 kilometre. That's how long 1 kilometre is. Now, imagine walking that distance not just once... but TEN times! That's how far Cronulla Beach is from our house."

Cassie's eyes go wide. Ten times! That's a LOT of walking!

But wait—her brain is getting busy. If she walks to the park, that's 1 kilometre. But what if she walks there AND back home? How far would that be?

"Mum! If I walk to the park and back, that's TWO kilometres, right?"

"Exactly right, clever girl!"

Cassie holds up her hands. She's going to figure out how many trips that would be! She starts counting on her fingers.

"One trip to the park and back is 2 kilometres." She sticks out two fingers.

"A second trip would be another 2 kilometres." Two more fingers pop out. She has four fingers showing. "That's 4 kilometres for two trips!"

She keeps going, skip counting like she learned in school.

"Third trip is 2 more... that's 6 kilometres!" Six fingers out now.

"Fourth trip is 2 more... that's 8 kilometres!" Eight fingers wiggling.

"Fifth trip is 2 more... that's 10 kilometres!" All ten fingers are up in the air!

"MUM! It's FIVE trips to the park and back! That's how far the beach is!"

Mum beams at her through the rearview mirror. "Brilliant skip counting, Cassie! Five trips to the park—that IS far, isn't it? That's probably why I'm driving us instead of walking!"

Cassie settles back in her seat, feeling very pleased with herself. Five whole trips worth of distance. No wonder they need the car!

But then...

"Are we there YET?" Caleb interrupts again, his little legs kicking impatiently.

Cassie sighs. "Caleb, we JUST talked about this. It's 10 kilometres away, that's really far!"

But then she stops. Wait a minute. They know how FAR they're going... but that doesn't actually tell Caleb when they'll get there! Caleb wants to know how LONG, not how far!

"Actually, Mum," Cassie says slowly, thinking hard, "we know it's 10 kilometres. But that doesn't help us know how long until we arrive, does it? We need to tell Caleb WHEN we'll get there so he stops asking!"

Mum glances back with a proud smile. "Cassie, that's very thoughtful. You're absolutely right—we have a problem to solve! We know how far we're going, but not how long it will take to get there."

"So how DO we figure that out?" Cassie asks.

"Well, we make a thoughtful guess! And to make a good guess, we need to understand SPEED."

"Speed?"

"Speed is how many kilometres we travel in a certain amount of time—like in one minute. The more kilometres you travel in a minute, the faster you're going!"

"Vroom vroom!" Caleb squeaks, pretending to drive a race car.

Mum laughs. "Exactly, Caleb! Now, the car is a very interesting machine. When we drive, the car wheels spin round and round. Each time the wheel goes around one full spin, the car moves forward a certain distance."

Cassie looks down toward the floor of the car, imagining the wheels spinning beneath them.

"How far the car moves in one spin," Mum continues, "depends on the size of the wheel—specifically, the circumference. Do you know what circumference is?"

Cassie shakes her head.

"Imagine you take a piece of string and wrap it all the way around the edge of a wheel, just once. The length of that string would be the circumference—the distance around the outside of the wheel!"

"Oh! Like wrapping a ribbon around a present?" Cassie asks.

"Just like that! Now, let's imagine something. Let's say our wheel's circumference is 1 kilometre—I know that's a HUGE imaginary wheel, but let's pretend."

Cassie giggles at the thought of giant wheels.

"So if the wheel goes around one spin, the car travels 1 kilometre. Right?"

"Right!"

"Now, if the wheel spins TWO times in one minute, how far would the car travel in that minute?"

Cassie thinks. One spin is 1 kilometre. Two spins is... "2 kilometres!"

"YES! So in that case, the car's speed would be 2 kilometres per minute. We write it like this: 2 km per minute."

Cassie nods, following along.

"Now, here's the fun part. If we're traveling at 2 kilometres per minute, how many minutes would it take to travel 10 kilometres? Time for more skip counting!"

Cassie holds up her hands again. "2 kilometres in 1 minute... 4 kilometres in 2 minutes... 6 kilometres in 3 minutes... 8 kilometres in 4 minutes... 10 kilometres in 5 minutes!"

"FIVE MINUTES!" she announces. "We'd get there in 5 minutes!"

"Oh no," Cassie then says, looking at Caleb. "Five minutes is still a long time for Caleb. He asks 'are we there yet' every single minute!"

Mum chuckles. "Well, here's the thing. We're not going quite that fast. We have traffic lights to stop at, and other cars on the road, and busy intersections. Considering everything, we're probably traveling at about 1 kilometre per minute today."

"So if we go 1 kilometre every minute..." Cassie starts counting again, but this time it's easy. "That's 10 minutes for 10 kilometres!"

"10 minutes!" both children exclaim.

Cassie turns to her brother. "Caleb, listen very carefully. Don't ask 'are we there yet' for another 10 minutes, okay? Count to ten really slowly, ten times, and THEN you can ask!"

Caleb nods seriously. "Okay, Cassie. Ten minutes." He starts counting on his fingers, murmuring to himself.

Cassie looks out the window, watching the houses and trees pass by. Her brain is full of new ideas about distance and time and speed. Who knew there was so much to think about just driving to the beach?

# Chapter 3: The Ball Up in the Air

Cassie is enjoying the view outside her window. Houses zoom by. Trees flash past. A dog walker waves as they drive past.

Then Cassie notices something very strange.

She watches the tall eucalyptus trees across the street. They seem to be... RUNNING! Running backwards, away from her!

But wait. That can't be right. Trees don't run! Trees have roots—Mum told her that this morning! Trees can't move!

And yet... watching them through the window... it really LOOKS like the trees are traveling away from her, sliding backwards into the distance.

"That's so WEIRD," Cassie murmurs.

She knows that SHE is the one traveling. She's in the car, moving forward. The trees are standing still, rooted in the ground. But her eyes are telling her something different!

Have you ever noticed this too? When you're in a car or a train, watch the things outside. Don't they seem to be moving, even though YOU'RE the one going somewhere?

"Mum," Cassie asks, "why do I feel like the trees are traveling away from me? I KNOW we're the ones moving. I know trees can't walk! But it LOOKS like they're running backwards!"

Mum nods thoughtfully. "That's a wonderful observation, Cassie. What you're noticing is all about how we SEE movement. It depends on where you're watching from!"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, think about it. You, Caleb, and I are all traveling in this car, right? We're all moving at the same speed, in the same direction."

"Right..."

"So when you look at me, do I seem to be moving?"

Cassie looks at Mum in the driver's seat. Mum is sitting still, hands on the wheel. She doesn't look like she's going anywhere!

"No! You look still!"

"And Caleb? Is he zooming past you?"

Cassie looks at Caleb beside her. Nope. He's just sitting there, counting on his fingers.

"No, he's still too!"

"But to those trees outside—if they could see us—we would ALL be zooming past at 1 kilometre per minute! To the trees, we're the ones moving. But to US, looking at each other inside the car, nobody seems to be moving at all."

Cassie's brain is doing somersaults. "So... movement looks different depending on where you're watching from?"

"Exactly! And from where you're sitting, the car is staying in the same place around you—but the trees are getting further and further away. So your eyes tell you the trees are moving, even though your brain knows they're not!"

"Woah," Cassie breathes. "That's a brain twister, Mum!"

"It really is!" Caleb agrees, looking up from his counting.

Both children are really excited about everything they've learned today. They can't wait to share it all with their friends!

Mum has a mischievous smile on her face. "I have another puzzle for you. Are you ready?"

"YES!" both children shout.

"Okay. Cassie, you have your ball there on your lap, right?"

Cassie looks down. Her red rubber ball is sitting right next to her.

"What do you think would happen if you tossed that ball straight up in the air, right now, while the car is moving?"

Cassie picks up the ball and thinks hard. They're moving forward. If she throws the ball up, and the car keeps moving forward... won't the car drive away from the ball? Won't the ball land... behind her?

"I think... it will land behind me?" she guesses. "Because we'll keep driving forward while the ball goes up?"

"Interesting guess! Why don't you try it and see?"

Cassie holds the ball carefully. She tosses it straight up toward the roof of the car. Up it goes... she watches it rise... then it starts to fall back down...

PLOP! It lands right back in her lap!

"WHAT?!" Cassie is shocked. "How did it come back to ME? We're moving forward!"

Mum is grinning. "Aha! Here's the secret. Think about this: before you threw the ball, where was the ball?"

"In my lap."

"And were you moving?"

"Yes, in the car."

"So was the ball ALSO moving?"

Cassie's eyes widen. "The ball was moving forward too! Even though it was just sitting in my lap!"

"YES! The ball was already traveling at the same speed as you and the car. When you tossed it up, the ball didn't just go UP—it also kept going FORWARD at the same speed it was already going!"

Cassie stares at the ball in her hands with new wonder. "So even though it felt like the ball was still... it was actually zooming forward the whole time?"

"Exactly! The ball went up and down, but it ALSO kept moving forward with you. That's why it landed right back in your lap!"

"So the ball had MY speed!" Cassie exclaims. "It was already moving with me!"

"You've got it!"

Caleb is bouncing with excitement. "Me throw! Me throw!"

"I have an even better experiment," Mum says. "What do you think would happen if I SLOWED DOWN the car right after you threw the ball up?"

Cassie thinks very hard. If she throws the ball, it has her speed. If Mum slows down, then she and the car will be going slower... but the ball will still have the faster speed!

"The ball would go further forward than us! It would land... in FRONT of me!"

"Shall we try at the next stop sign?"

They wait until they approach a stop sign. Mum tells Cassie to get ready. Cassie throws the ball straight up—and Mum gently brakes.

The ball comes down and—PLOP!—lands near Caleb's feet, in front of where Cassie was sitting!

"It worked! It went forward!" Cassie squeals with delight.

Caleb picks up the ball and hands it back to his sister, giggling.

"Now," Mum says, "I bet you can figure this out. What would happen if I SPED UP after you threw the ball?"

Cassie doesn't even hesitate. "Then WE would be going faster than the ball! The ball would fall BEHIND me!"

"Want to try?"

They wait for a safe, empty stretch of road. Cassie throws the ball up, and Mum presses the accelerator just a little. Down comes the ball—PLOP!—landing behind Cassie, near the back window!

"I KNEW it! I knew it!" Cassie cheers.

They all burst into giggles. Caleb claps his hands. This is the best car ride EVER!

"Woah, Mum," Cassie says, catching her breath. "This is SO super cool! Why didn't you tell us about this before?"

Mum smiles warmly at her through the mirror. "Well, I'm telling you now! And here's the most important thing, Cassie. You keep asking questions. You keep thinking. You keep putting on your curious cap! When you do that, you'll discover amazing things everywhere you look."

"I promise, Mum. I'll always be curious!"

---

At that moment, Caleb shouts: "I SEE THE BEACH! I SEE THE WATER!"

Sure enough, through the windshield, they can see the sparkling blue of Cronulla Beach stretching out ahead of them. White waves are rolling onto the golden sand. Seagulls are circling in the bright blue sky.

They've arrived!

As Mum pulls into the parking lot and finds a spot, she turns around to face both children.

"Before we run onto that beautiful beach, I want to tell you about someone very special. Someone who was just like you, Cassie—curious about everything!"

Cassie and Caleb lean forward to listen.

"His name was Isaac Newton. He lived a long, long time ago—hundreds of years ago—in England. And when he was young, he asked questions about EVERYTHING, just like you do."

"What kind of questions?" Cassie asks.

"Well, everyone noticed things falling to the ground—apples from trees, rain from the sky. But Isaac Newton was the one who got CURIOUS about it. He asked WHY things fall. And he kept thinking and thinking until he figured out the answer—gravity!"

"Gravity!" Cassie exclaims. "Like we learned this morning!"

"Exactly! And everyone noticed that when you travel, things LOOK like they're moving even when they're standing still. But Isaac Newton explored and explained WHY we feel that way."

"Like the trees looking like they were running backwards!"

"Just like that! And the experiment with the ball—Newton figured out those rules too. Things that are moving want to keep moving!"

Cassie feels a warm glow in her chest. She was thinking about the same things that a famous scientist thought about!

"Mum," she asks, "was Newton super duper smart?"

"He WAS very smart. But do you know what his real secret was?"

Cassie shakes her head.

"He once said: 'If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.' That means his secret wasn't just being clever—it was TRYING hard. Thinking hard. Being curious and never giving up on finding answers."

Cassie takes this in. Thinking hard. Being curious. She can do that!

"And you know what else?" Mum adds. "One of the greatest scientists of ALL time—Albert Einstein—once said something similar. He said: 'I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.'"

"Passionately curious," Cassie repeats softly. "That means REALLY curious. Really, really wanting to know things."

"That's exactly right. And that's what you are, Cassie. And you too, Caleb! You both ask wonderful questions. Never stop asking them, okay?"

"Okay, Mum!" both children chorus.

"That's very inspiring, Mum. Thanks for telling us!" Cassie says, unbuckling her seatbelt. Her heart is full of excitement—for the beach, for science, for all the questions she hasn't even thought of yet!

---

# Chapter 4: Discoveries at the Beach!

The car doors fly open and Cassie and Caleb tumble out onto the warm pavement. The smell of salt and seaweed fills the air. The sound of crashing waves calls to them.

"BEACH!" Caleb shouts, toddling toward the sand as fast as his little legs can carry him.

Cassie runs after him, her bare feet hitting the sand. It's warm! The grains squish between her toes. She runs toward the water, feeling the sand change from dry and soft to wet and firm.

SPLASH! A wave rushes up and tickles her ankles. The water is cool and fizzy with foam. Cassie laughs with pure joy!

She looks around. The beach is HUGE! The sky is so big and blue! Everything feels open and free and wonderful!

Mum catches up with a big beach bag full of towels and snacks. "Shall we set up our spot and build the biggest sandcastle ever?"

"YES!" both children agree.

They find the perfect spot—not too close to the water, not too far away. Mum spreads out a big blanket, and Cassie and Caleb get to work.

Cassie scoops up wet sand and starts piling it into a mound. She pats it firmly, feeling the sand press back against her hands. Wait... feeling the sand PRESS BACK?

Cassie pauses. She pushes down on the sand with her palm. The sand pushes UP against her palm! She can feel it!

"Mum!" she calls out. "I'm pushing DOWN on the sand... but I can feel it pushing UP on me!"

Mum comes over, delighted. "You've discovered something else that Newton figured out! He noticed that whenever you push something, it pushes you right back!"

"Everything pushes back?"

"Try this—push against the sand with your hand. Feel how it pushes back? That's why your hand doesn't just sink right through! Now push the side of the sandcastle."

Cassie pushes the side of their sand mound. She can feel the resistance—the sand pushing her hand away!

"I feel it! The sand is pushing me back!"

"Newton called this the Third Law: for every push, there's a push back. You push the sand, the sand pushes you. You push the ground when you walk, the ground pushes you forward!"

Caleb is splashing in a small pool of water nearby. Each time he slaps the water, it splashes back at him!

"Caleb is learning it too!" Cassie points. "He pushes the water, and the water splashes him back!"

Caleb giggles, delighted by the splashing. "Water pushes me! Water pushes me!"

Cassie goes back to building. Every pat of the sand, every scoop with her hands—she notices the push and the push-back. It's like she can feel Newton's law working with every movement!

They build and build. The sandcastle grows taller and wider. Towers rise up with shells decorating their tops. Caleb digs a moat around the castle—and every time his shovel hits the sand, he can feel the sand pushing back against it.

"We have to push the shovel, and the sand pushes the shovel back!" Caleb announces proudly. He's learning so much today!

After the castle is finished—their best one ever—they run to the water to splash and swim and play. Cassie floats on her back, looking up at the endless blue sky. She thinks about gravity, holding her down against the water. She thinks about the water pushing up against her, keeping her floating.

Everything is connected! Everything has a reason!

---

Later, as the afternoon sun starts to sink lower in the sky, something magical happens.

The waves crash and send up a fine mist of spray. The sunlight catches the mist just right, and suddenly—

"MUM! CASSIE! LOOK!" Caleb points with his sandy finger.

A RAINBOW! Arching over the ocean, glowing with colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet!

They all stand together at the water's edge, gazing at the beautiful arc of color.

"It's so pretty," Cassie whispers. "Where do the colors come from?"

Mum puts an arm around each child. "This is another one of Newton's discoveries! He found out that white sunlight—the light that seems to have no color—is actually made of ALL the colors mixed together!"

"All of them? Hidden inside?"

"All of them! Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet—all hiding inside what looks like plain white light. When sunlight passes through tiny water droplets, like in that mist, the water separates the light into all its hidden colors. That's how we get a rainbow!"

Cassie stares at the rainbow in wonder. "So the colors were hiding in the sunshine the WHOLE time? And we just couldn't see them?"

"Until the water droplets revealed them! Newton figured this out using a special piece of glass called a prism. He shined light through it and saw the rainbow of colors come out the other side. People had seen rainbows for thousands of years, but Newton was the first to understand WHY they happen!"

Cassie thinks about all the things she's learned today.

Gravity—why things fall down.
Movement—why some things can move and others can't.
Speed and distance—how far and how fast.
Relative motion—why things look like they're moving when they're not.
The ball experiment—how moving things keep moving.
Push and push-back—the Third Law.
And now, the hidden colors of light!

And all of these things were puzzled out by one curious person who never stopped asking questions.

"Mum," Cassie says quietly, "I want to be like Isaac Newton. I want to keep asking why. I want to discover things!"

Mum hugs her tight. "You already are, sweetheart. Every question you ask is a step on your own discovery journey!"

The rainbow starts to fade as the mist settles. But the wonder stays, glowing inside Cassie's heart.

---

The sun is setting now, painting the sky in oranges and pinks and purples—its own kind of rainbow! The family gathers their things, shaking sand out of towels and collecting shells to take home.

As they walk back to the car, Cassie takes Caleb's hand. They're both tired from all the playing, but their minds are full of new ideas.

Cassie puts on her curious cap—her invisible, imaginary cap that reminds her to always wonder, always ask, always explore.

She starts to sing, and Caleb joins in:

*Let's go marching up and down,*
*Let's go moving all around,*
*Let's make some sandy towers,*
*Let's all scamper at this hour!*

*Newton watched an apple fall,*
*And wondered about it all!*
*He asked why and he asked how,*
*We're asking questions now!*

*I am marching up and down,*
*I am moving all around,*
*Gravity brings me to the ground,*
*And wonder is all around!*

As they drive home under the first evening stars, Cassie looks out the window. This time, she watches the trees "run" backwards with a smile. She understands why it looks that way now.

She thinks about the Walking Palm, slowly chasing the sunshine.

She thinks about gravity, the Earth's gentle hug.

She thinks about her ball, flying up and falling back down while still moving forward.

She thinks about the rainbow, hiding in the sunlight.

Just like Isaac Newton, Cassie knows the secret now:

Stay curious. Think hard. Never stop asking WHY.
