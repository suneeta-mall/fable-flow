# Story

Chapter 1: Let’s get moving

Cassie is a curious 6 years old child. She loves thinking and asking interesting questions. Today her mum is driving Cassie and Cassie’s 3 year old brother Caleb to Cronulla Beach for an adventurous day! Sssh .. Cassie does not know it yet!

Cassie is playing in the backyard sandpit under the shade of a beautiful yellow wattle tree. “Let's get moving Cassie! We are going to the beach!” - calls Cassie’s mum. Cassie is excited. She loves beaches and sand. Who does not, right? She slowly says M  O  V  E! She is thinking! Slowly she beams - Curious Cassie has a question!

“You and I can move. Why can't the trees move?” Asks Cassie. Ooh, that’s a brilliant question Cassie - mum exclaims! The tree has its roots deep in the ground. The roots keep the tree firm in the ground. We have legs and we are not fixed in the ground. “See!” mum says as she shakes her legs and does a little hop like a bunny. We can lift our legs and bring them down to the ground; that’s how we move around - mum explains. Cassie is convinced and goes back to playing in her sandpit.

Cassie’s mum suddenly recalls a fun fact about a special kind of tree - one of its kind. A walking tree that grows in the tropical rainforest. It’s called “Walking palm”. Excitedly, mum tells Cassie - “There is a special type of tree called “walking palm” in the tropical rainforest. This tree can move a teensy bit to get some sunlight.”
Cassie is amazed now. She runs to find her brother Caleb and shares -” Caleb! Caleb! Did you know, there is a special tree that can walk?”. 


They both rush back to mum to find out more. “Tell us more mum, how does it walk with roots in the ground?” asks Cassie. 
Mum explains that this tree grows new roots in the direction of sunshine. The sunshine is very important for the trees. Because the trees use sunshine to make their food. We all need food, right? Both Cassie and Caleb smile to acknowledge that food is important to live. Mum adds further, as the new roots grow towards the sunshine, the walking palm slowly bends its stump forward to the new root. “What happens when you bend Caleb?” - mum asks. My butt-butt feels stretchy, giggles, Caleb, as he tries bending forward. Exactly, mum continues explaining. Because of the bend, the old roots not facing sunshine get pulled out then - and dry out. That is how this fun wattle tree moves. Mum adds, but this is a very very slow process and takes years to move even the tiniest bit! Nonetheless, that’s your moving tree! Cassie and Caleb are thrilled! What a fun fact mum - we love it! 


Cassie is back to the sandpit and the wattle tree. Cassie scoops some sand in her spade and tosses it up in the air. Up up it goes and down down it comes. She chuckles! Whoops, it's drizzling, the water drops are falling. 
Everything comes down, I wonder why? Cassie thinks. Wouldn't it be fun if the sand and rain just float? She hollers “Mum, why does everything come to the ground?”. Because of gravity sweety - mum replies. Do you know what that means? She asks. Cassie shakes her head. “The ground pulls everything towards itself. Not very strongly but a bit lightly. We can't see it, but we can feel it.” - mum says. Cassie tries a bunny jump and wonders for a minute. She is thinking about what mum just said. She takes another bunny hop. She wants to feel what the earth will do. “Ooh! I feel nothing mum.” she says. 

“Okay. Let's jump together.” - mum is determined to help Cassie feel the gravity. They both jump and bang! They both come down. Were you making an effort when you jumped? Did you squeeze your legs and try to lift yourself to go up? Did you? What about when you come down? Try noticing what you were doing? Were you doing anything to come down? Asks mum. Cassie tries again. “Aha ha ha. I get it. I made an effort to go up but did not have to do anything because gravity pulled me down?” says Cassie. There you go, that's your gravity. Gravity brought your sand and rain down to the ground. How super duper awesome, isn't it? Exclaims Cassie’s mum! Cassie does two more hops and then another two, she is jumping unstoppably. She wants to thank gravity for making jumping so much fun! She suddenly recalls that they were going to the beach and she can’t wait to get to the beach now. She starts singing:

I am marching up and down,
I am moving all around,
I am going to the town,
Where beaches are abound,

I will make some sandy towers,
And, show my superpowers,
I will jump up and down the towers,
And, scamper about at this hour,

I am marching up and down,
I am moving all around,
I am going to the town,
Where beaches abound,


Chapter 2: Driving to the beach

Cassie’s mum gathers Cassie and Caleb and buckles them in the car! She ignites the engine. She is just about ready to vroom vroom when Caleb asks “Are we there yet?”.
Mum and Cassie giggle and tell Caleb that they have not even moved at all. He is getting really impatient to arrive at the beach now. Curious Cassie beams again. She wants to imagine how far the beach is in her brain! She asks her mum how much they need to move to get to the beach. Mum says 10 kilometres. 10 kilometres - what does that even mean, Cassie, wonders with a big question mark on her head. 

Kilometre is how you measure distance. Imagine the distance when we walk from home to Aqua Flora Park. The distance you cover is 1 kilometre. Now imagine going that distance 10 times! That’s how far Cronulla beach is from home. Mum tells Cassie and Caleb. 

Cassie’s brain is now busy thinking. She realises if she goes to the park from home and comes back, she would have travelled how many kilometres? 2! I wonder how many times she does this to cover 10 kilometres for the beach? She starts to skip count on her fingers.

One round trip from home to the park and back home is 2 kilometres. Cassie recounts and takes 2 fingers out. The second trip is another 2 kilometres, she takes another 2 fingers out. She has 4 fingers out. She has counted that 2 trips are 4 kilometres . She goes on opening another 2 fingers for the third trip. She continues, the 4th trip is another 2 kilometres. She has 8 fingers open for a total distance of 8 kilometres for 4 trips. She is counting to 10 kilometres, isn't she? She opens another 2 fingers for the 5th trip and now all her fingers are open! She has just calculated 10 kilometres for the beach. She is bursting with enthusiasm! “Mum, it's 5 trips! I skip counted.` she says. 5 trips! That’s too many trips to the park, isn't it? That's probably why mum is driving them instead!

“Are we there yet mum?” Caleb interrupts again. Cassie reflects - “We know it's 10 kilometres and it's too far. But that does not really help to decide how long until we get there. Does it? We really need to tell Caleb that so he stops being annoying.” - Cassies blurts out. Mum reminds her to be nice to her little brother first. Be nice Cassie, she says. 

So, we have a problem. We know how far we are going but not how long it will take us to get there, right? Asks mum. Both Cassie and Caleb nod. Well, we don't really know so what we do is make a thoughtful guess. Let's see how to make that guess, mum says. She then goes on to explain - “When we drive the car we know how many kilometres we are going in a minute. This is called the speed of the car. The more kilometres in a minute you go, the faster you are going.”. Caleb squeaks, “Vroom vroom!”.

“The car is a very interesting machine, you know!” - mum tells them excitedly. When we drive the car, the car wheels spin. How many kilometres the car will move in one spin is calculated by the circumference of the wheel. “Do you know what circumference is?” asks mum. If you take a rope and wrap it along the edge of the wheel only just once, then the size of the rope is the circumference of the wheel, explains mum. Perhaps you can try on your bike wheels when we get back home, suggests mum.

Cassie is puzzled. Are you too? Mum explains further. Let’s say the wheel circumference is 1 kilometre. So for every spin, the car would travel 1 kilometre. Right? If the car is making 2 spins every minute then in 2 spins how long would the car have travelled? Cassie's eyes are buzzing with enthusiasm! 2!! She yells excitedly. Exactly, mum says. So, in this case, the car would be travelling at the speed of 2 kilometres in 1 minute. 

Let’s do some skip counting again. How many minutes until the car travels 10 kilometres then? Cassie counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!! 5 minutes Cassie replies. Mum is thrilled at how thoughtful Cassie is. So we will reach the beach in 5 minutes if the car was going at 2 km/m speed. Oh no, 5 minutes is too long. Caleb is asking all the time, ponders Cassie. 
But we have traffic lights and busy roads so we would be going slower. Considering everything, I think we may drive at about 1 kilometre per minute today. What does that mean kids, how long will it take to travel to the beach then? 10 minutes both yell. Cassie tells Caleb, “Caleb, don’t ask if we are there yet for another 10 minutes, Okay?”. Caleb agrees and smiles.


Chapter 3: The ball up in the air

Cassie is enjoying the view outside and notices that the eucalyptus trees across the street are running past her. That's weird. She is curious. We are travelling and not the tree. Trees don't walk but I feel trees are moving! How odd is it! (Have you noticed this too when you go out in the car or train?)

Cassie asks her mum why she feels like trees are travelling away from her when as a matter of fact she is travelling. 
It is because you are observing how things are moving as compared to yourself Cassie, mum explains. She continues… see, you, Caleb and I are travelling in the same car at the same speed. So when we compare ourselves to each other, none of us is moving any faster or slower. We are all just going the same distance at the same time. That's why to each other we appear still! To those trees across the street, all three of us are moving at 1kilometer per minute speed! But for us, we are leaving that tree behind at the same speed we are moving forward! 
Woah that's a brain twister mum, Caleb mentions and cassie nods. Both are really excited about what they learnt today and can’t wait to share it all with their friends

Mummy cheekily pops this question - what do you think will happen if you toss a ball up in the air right now? 
Hmmm, I reckon it will go back, says Cassie. Cassie then tosses the ball up in the air. Swoosh it goes up and comes right down close to her! 
Cassie is shocked! Mum explains what just happened. The ball came back to you while you were moving in the car. Does not that mean the ball was also moving at the same speed in the same direction as you? If you moved 1 kilometre forward in the time the ball went up and came down, then for the ball to come back to you, the ball would have travelled the same kilometre forward as well right?  Cassie is smiling, she is getting it now. 
So the ball was already having my speed - yes? Cassie asks. Yes, mum smiles.


How exciting is that. Can you think of what would happen if I slowed down the car after you threw the ball up, mum asks. Cassie thinks in her brain, then the ball would go longer than we would because we are slower than the ball. I know! I know, the ball would go in forward, replies Cassie. They then tried and it really did. They all giggled! Just as mum was about to say anything, Cassie yells, and if you go faster after I throw the ball, we all know where the ball would go right? Caleb answers himself excitedly back! They all have a good chuckle! “Woah, this is so super cool mum, why didn't you tell us before?” prods Cassie! “Well I am telling you now, you just keep asking, always thinking, putting your curious cap on! Alright?” requests mum to both Cassie and Caleb.


Caleb and Cassie can now see the beach! They have arrived. They are thrilled. Just as they start to unbuckle, mum tells them about a very curious kid Isaac Newton. He grew up to be a great philosopher and explained a lot of the things we discussed today.  Everyone noticed things falling to the ground, but it was Sir Isaac Newton who got curious and followed his quest to explain gravity. Everyone noticed that when you travel, some things “appear” to be moving when they are actually not, but it was Sir Isaac Newton who explored and explained why we feel this way. 

She tells them about a famous thing Sir Isaac Newton once said when he was asked how he managed to achieve great things:

“If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.”

Did you know that one of the greatest scientists of all time, Albert Einstein once said, '' I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious”, mum tells Cassie and Caleb and commends them for being so curious and asking questions, 

“That’s very inspiring mum - thanks for telling us!” says Cassie. Caleb nobs. They, then, put their curious cap on and starts to sing:

Lets go marching up and down,
Lets go moving all around,
Lets make some sandy towers,
Let’s all scamper at this hour!
