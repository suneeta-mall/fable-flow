      <p class="story-text">Welcome to Cassie's adventure—a journey that transforms an ordinary trip to the beach into
        an extraordinary exploration of physics! Through Cassie's curious questions and her mum's thoughtful
        explanations, young readers discover that science isn't confined to laboratories or textbooks. It's everywhere
        around us, waiting to be noticed and understood.</p>

      <p class="story-text">This book introduces fundamental physics concepts—gravity, motion, speed, distance, and
        relativity—through experiences children encounter every day. When Cassie wonders why trees don't walk, when
        Caleb grows impatient in the car, when the world seems to rush backward outside the window, these become
        teachable moments that spark understanding. Each question leads to discovery, each observation unlocks a
        scientific principle, and each experiment proves that learning happens best when curiosity leads the way.</p>

      <p class="story-text">Parents and educators will find this book bridges the gap between wonder and knowledge. The
        concepts presented here align with Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, yet they're explained through playful
        dialogue, hands-on experiments, and memorable rhymes that help young minds grasp complex ideas. From bunny hops
        that demonstrate gravity to ball-tossing experiments that reveal relative motion, every activity invites
        participation and deeper thinking.</p>

      <p class="story-text">As you read together, encourage your young scientist to ask "why" and "how" just like Cassie
        does. Let their questions guide your conversations. Try the experiments together. Observe the world with fresh
        eyes. Most importantly, celebrate curiosity as the foundation of all scientific discovery. After all, every
        great scientist—from Newton to today's innovators—started as a curious child who dared to ask questions about
        the world around them.</p>

    <p class="story-text">The car doors chunked shut with satisfying clicks as Mum buckled Cassie and Caleb safely into
      their car seats. The leather was warm from the sun, and the car smelled like the coconut air freshener hanging
      from the rearview mirror. Mum slid into the driver's seat, adjusted her sunglasses, and turned the key.</p>

    <p class="story-text">The engine purred to life.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Before they'd even moved an inch—before Mum had even put the car in gear—Caleb's eager voice
      piped up from the backseat: <span class="dialogue question">"Are we there yet?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">The question hung in the air for just a moment before both Mum and Cassie burst into laughter.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Caleb!"</span> Cassie giggled, twisting in her seat to look at her
      little brother. <span class="dialogue">"We haven't even started moving! Look—we're still in our driveway! You can
        see our house right there!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb craned his neck to peer out the window, then slumped back with a dramatic sigh that
      seemed far too big for such a small person. <span class="dialogue">"But I want to be at the beach now!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Patience, my little eager beaver,"</span> Mum said warmly, checking
      her mirrors. <span class="dialogue">"We'll get there soon enough. I know waiting is hard sometimes, but good
        things are worth the wait."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">But Cassie's mind had already latched onto something new. She stared out the window at their
      familiar street, trying to imagine the journey ahead. <span class="dialogue question">"Mum, how far away is the
        beach? Like... how much do we have to move to get there?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Excellent question! The beach is about ten kilometers from our
        house."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Ten kilometers."</span> Cassie repeated the words, but they felt
      empty, like saying a word in a language she didn't understand. She could picture ten cookies or ten toys, but ten
      kilometers? Her brain couldn't quite grasp it. She imagined a big floating question mark above her head, blinking
      like a neon sign.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Mum caught her confused expression in the rearview mirror and smiled. <span
        class="dialogue question">"A kilometer is a way of measuring distance—how far apart two places are. You know how
        we sometimes walk to Aqua Flora Park?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Both children nodded. They loved that park with its water features and the tall slide that
      made your tummy flip.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"The distance from our house to the park is one kilometer. So imagine
        walking all the way to the park, turning around, and coming all the way back home. Then doing that same walk
        again. And again. And again. If you did that five times total, you would have traveled ten kilometers. That's
        how far away Cronulla Beach is."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie's eyes grew wide. <em>Five times?!</em> That seemed impossibly far. No wonder Mum was
      driving instead of walking!</p>

    <p class="story-text">But now her mathematical mind was churning, the gears turning like a curious clock. She held
      up her hands, fingers splayed wide, and began to work through the problem.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"So one trip to the park and back is two kilometers,"</span> she
      murmured to herself, folding down two fingers. <span class="dialogue">"That's one round trip. Then another trip to
        the park and back—that's two more kilometers."</span> She folded down two more fingers. <span
        class="dialogue">"That makes four kilometers total after two round trips."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Her tongue poked out slightly as she concentrated, folding down another two fingers. <span
        class="dialogue">"The third round trip is six kilometers... then eight kilometers after four trips..."</span>
      One more pair of fingers. <span class="dialogue">"And ten kilometers after five trips!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">She looked up triumphantly, all ten fingers now folded down. <span class="dialogue">"I did it!
        I skip-counted by twos! Five round trips equals ten kilometers!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"That's brilliant mental mathematics, Cassie!"</span> Mum's voice was
      warm with pride. <span class="dialogue question">"See how skip counting helps us understand big numbers?"</span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie bounced in her seat and chanted:</p>

    <div class="poem-box">
      <p class="poem-verse">Two, four, six—the rhythm flows,<br />Eight, then ten—see how it
        goes?<br />Every number finds its place,<br />In this mathematical space!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"But Mum?"</span> Cassie's brow furrowed again. <span
        class="dialogue">"Knowing it's ten kilometers still doesn't tell Caleb when we'll get there. He wants to know
        <em>when</em>, not how far."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"ARE WE THERE YET?"</span> Caleb chimed in right on cue, as if to prove
      Cassie's point.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie started to respond with frustration, but Mum gently interrupted. <span
        class="dialogue">"Remember, Cassie, we use kind words with our little brother. You were three once too, and I'm
        sure you asked the same question!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie nodded sheepishly. <span class="dialogue">"Sorry, Caleb. I was just trying to help you
        understand."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"That's better,"</span> Mum said warmly. <span class="dialogue">"And
        you're absolutely right that we have a puzzle to solve!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">She paused at a stop sign, checking both ways before continuing. <span class="dialogue">"We
        know how far we're going—that's our distance, ten kilometers. But to figure out when we'll arrive, we need to
        know something else: our speed. Speed tells us how many kilometers we travel in a certain amount of
        time."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Vroom vroom!"</span> Caleb interjected, making car noises.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Exactly, Caleb! Vroom vroom! The faster we vroom, the higher our
        speed. Now, here's something fascinating about how cars actually work."</span> Mum's voice took on that special
      quality of someone about to share a truly interesting secret.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"You see these wheels?"</span> She gestured to the front of
      the car, even though they couldn't see them from inside. <span class="dialogue">"Every time a wheel makes one
        complete spin—one full rotation all the way around—the car moves forward. The distance it moves depends on
        something called the wheel's circumference."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"Circum-what?"</span> Cassie stumbled over the new word.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Circumference,"</span> Mum repeated patiently. <span
        class="dialogue">"It's the distance all the way around the outside edge of something circular—like a wheel.
        Imagine you took a piece of string and wrapped it carefully around the wheel, just once, touching all along the
        outer edge. Then you took that string off and measured how long it was. That length is the
        circumference."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">She pulled onto a straightaway where she could safely talk while driving carefully. <span
        class="dialogue">"Here's the fun part: if a wheel's circumference was one kilometer—which would be a very big
        wheel, by the way—then every time that wheel spun around once, the car would move forward one kilometer."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie tried to picture it in her mind: the wheel rolling, rolling, marking off distance with
      each rotation.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"So,"</span> Mum continued, <span
        class="dialogue question">"if that big wheel was spinning twice every minute, how far would the car travel in
        one minute?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie's eyes lit up. <span class="dialogue">"Two kilometers! Because two spins times one
        kilometer each spin equals two kilometers!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Perfect! So in that case, the car's speed would be two kilometers per
        minute. We could write it as 2 km/min."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"Now for the really fun part—more skip counting! If we're
        traveling at 2 kilometers per minute, how many minutes would it take us to go 10 kilometers?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie closed her eyes, visualizing the problem. <span class="dialogue">"After one minute,
        we've gone two kilometers. After two minutes, four kilometers. After three minutes, six kilometers. After four
        minutes, eight kilometers. And after five minutes... ten kilometers! Five minutes!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Brilliant! So if we could travel at that speed, we'd reach the beach
        in just five minutes."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb's face fell. <span class="dialogue">"Five minutes is forever!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Well, here's the thing,"</span> Mum said gently. <span
        class="dialogue">"In real life, we can't always go that fast. We have traffic lights that make us stop and keep
        us safe. We have other cars sharing the road with us. We have speed limits to keep everyone safe—especially
        children like you! Sometimes we go slower, sometimes a bit faster. Today, with all the stops and starts and
        careful driving, we'll probably average about one kilometer per minute."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">She glanced at Cassie in the mirror. <span class="dialogue question">"So if we're going 1
        kilometer per minute, and we need to travel 10 kilometers..."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Ten minutes!"</span> both children shouted together.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue question">"That's right! So, Caleb, my impatient little one, instead of
        asking 'are we there yet?' every thirty seconds, can you wait at least ten minutes before asking again?"</span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb considered this seriously, then nodded. <span class="dialogue">"Okay, Mummy. Ten
        minutes. I can wait ten minutes."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie leaned back in her seat, feeling a warm glow of satisfaction. Mathematics wasn't just
      about numbers on paper—it was about solving real problems, answering real questions, understanding the world
      around her. She'd helped calm her brother's impatience using skip counting and multiplication!</p>

    <p class="story-text">She whispered softly to herself:</p>

    <div class="poem-box">
      <p class="poem-verse">Distance, time, and speed unite,<br />Mathematical patterns shine so
        bright!<br />Questions bloom in curious brains,<br />Learning through life's fun refrains!</p>

    <p class="story-text">The car rolled forward, wheels spinning precisely, each rotation carrying them closer to their
      seaside destination.</p>

    <p class="story-text">As the car hummed along the familiar streets toward Cronulla, Cassie pressed her face against
      the cool glass of the window, watching the world slide past. The afternoon sun painted everything in shades of
      gold and amber. Front yards with their neat gardens, letterboxes standing like sentinels, and tall eucalyptus
      trees lining the road—all of it seemed to flow backward, as if the whole neighborhood was being pulled away from
      her on an invisible conveyor belt.</p>

    <p class="story-text">A particularly magnificent eucalyptus caught her eye, its silvery-green leaves rustling in the
      breeze. She watched it approach, draw alongside, and then swoop past, as if it were racing away from them at
      tremendous speed.</p>

    <p class="story-text">But that didn't make sense. Not one bit.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie's eyebrows knitted together in that familiar way—the way that meant her brain was
      working on a particularly interesting puzzle. <span class="dialogue">"Mum?"</span> she began slowly, still staring
      at the retreating trees. <span class="dialogue">"Something really interesting is happening."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Oh? <span class="question">What's that, sweetie?</span>"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Well... we're the ones moving, right? The car is going forward,
        carrying us toward the beach. We're traveling."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"That's right."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"But..."</span> Cassie gestured at the window, trying to capture the
      strangeness of it. <span class="dialogue">"When I look out the window, it feels like we're sitting still and all
        the trees and houses and bushes are running backward! Like they're the ones moving, not us! Like the whole world
        is moving away from us instead of us moving through the world!"</span></p>

        way: right now, you, Caleb, and I are all in this car together. We're all moving at exactly the same speed—about
        one kilometer per minute, remember? We're traveling in exactly the same direction—toward the beach. So when you
        look at each other, what do you notice? <span class="question">Are you getting closer to each other? Farther
          apart?</span>"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie looked at Caleb. Caleb looked back at her. Neither of them had moved an inch relative
      to each other since they'd gotten in the car.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"We're staying the same distance apart,"</span> Cassie observed. <span
        class="dialogue">"Even though we're both moving."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Exactly! To each other, you appear to be still—not moving at
        all—because you're moving at the same speed in the same direction. You're like two boats floating down a river
        together. The river is moving, carrying both boats along, but the boats stay side by side."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"So we're moving together?"</span> Caleb asked.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Precisely! Now, think about those eucalyptus trees outside. <span
          class="question">Are they moving at the same speed as us? Are they traveling down the road too?</span>"</span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"No,"</span> Cassie said slowly, beginning to understand. <span
        class="dialogue">"They're standing still. They're not going anywhere."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Right! So while we're moving forward at one kilometer per minute,
        those trees are staying in one spot—zero kilometers per minute. Which means compared to us, it's like they're
        moving backward! We're zooming away from them, leaving them behind, so from inside our car it looks like they're
        rushing past us in the opposite direction."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb clapped his hands and began to chant:</p>

    <div class="poem-box">
      <p class="poem-verse">Still or moving? Watch and see,<br />
        It depends on where you be!<br />
        Trees stand still while we zoom by,<br />
        But from our seats, they seem to fly!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="story-text">Mum glanced at a road sign as they passed it. <span class="dialogue">"Think of it this way:
        imagine you're standing still and I walk past you. From your point of view, I'm moving and you're still. But
        from my point of view, I could think of it as if I'm staying in place and you're moving backward past me! Motion
        is all about perspective—about who's watching and where they're standing."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie's mind was spinning—not unlike the wheels beneath them. <span class="dialogue">"So when
        I'm watching the trees go past, it's the same as if the trees were watching me go past?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Exactly! To them—if trees could watch—we're the ones zooming by. But
        to us, they're the ones sliding past. Both perspectives are true, depending on your point of view!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">A thoughtful glint appeared in Mum's eyes. <span class="dialogue">"Now, would you like to do a
        special science experiment? This is something we can only do today because we're on a quiet road with very
        little traffic, and I'm saying it's okay for this one special learning moment."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Yes!"</span> both children chorused.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Mum reached into her bag—carefully, while keeping her eyes on the road—and pulled out a small
      rubber ball. It was blue with white stars, perfectly sized for small hands. She passed it back to Cassie.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"I want you to toss this ball straight up in the air, Cassie. Not too
        hard, just a gentle toss. But first, let's think like scientists and make a prediction. <span
          class="question">Where do you think the ball will land? In your lap? Behind you? In front of you? What's your
          hypothesis?</span>"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie turned the ball over in her hands, thinking hard. They were moving forward at one
      kilometer per minute. When she threw the ball up, they'd keep moving forward. The ball would go up and come down,
      but in the meantime...</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"I think it'll fall behind me,"</span> she said decisively. <span
        class="dialogue">"Because while it's in the air, the car will move forward, leaving the ball behind. So it'll
        land on the seat behind me, or maybe even on Caleb!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"That's good scientific reasoning! Let's test it. Ready? Toss it up
        gently!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie took a breath and tossed the ball straight up. Up it went, spinning slightly, the white
      stars blurring together. She watched it reach the top of its arc, hover for the tiniest moment...</p>

    <p class="story-text">And then it dropped right back down into her hands.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"What?!"</span> Cassie stared at the ball in shock. <span
        class="dialogue">"It came back to me! But... but how? <span class="question">We moved forward while it was in
          the air! Didn't we?</span>"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb clapped his hands together. <span class="dialogue">"Magic ball! Do it again!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Mum laughed, a sound full of delight. <span class="dialogue">"It does seem like magic, doesn't
        it? But there's a beautiful explanation. Think about this: before you tossed the ball, where was it?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"In my hands."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"And where were your hands?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"In the car."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"And how fast was the car—and everything in it, including you and the
        ball—traveling?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">The light of understanding began to dawn on Cassie's face. <span class="dialogue">"One
        kilometer per minute."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Exactly! So before you tossed it, the ball was already moving at one
        kilometer per minute, traveling in the same direction as the car. When you threw it up, you gave it upward
        motion, but it still had that forward motion from before. It's like the ball was on a moving walkway, and you
        made it jump—it jumps up, but it's still being carried forward by the walkway underneath."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"So while the ball was in the air,"</span> Cassie worked through it
      slowly, <span class="dialogue">"it was still going forward at the same speed as me and the car?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Precisely! In the time the ball went up and came down—maybe just one
        second—you moved forward a tiny bit. But the ball also moved forward that same tiny bit! So it came right back
        to your hands!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie whispered in wonder:</p>

    <div class="poem-box">
      <p class="poem-verse">Forward speed stays locked in place,<br />
        Even as the ball moves through space!<br />
        Objects keep their motion true,<br />
        Unless a force changes what they do!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie tossed the ball again, watching it with new eyes. Up it went, carrying its forward
      motion with it invisibly, and down it came, perfectly aligned with her traveling hands.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"But Mum,"</span> Cassie said, her eyes gleaming with the thrill of
      exploration, <span class="dialogue">"what would happen if you slowed down the car right after I threw the
        ball?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Ooh, excellent prediction question! What do you think?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie closed her eyes, visualizing it. <span class="dialogue">"The ball would still have the
        fast speed, but we'd be going slower. So the ball would go farther forward than us... and it would land in front
        of me!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Want to test it? We're on a nice quiet stretch, and I'll slow down
        very gently as soon as you toss. Ready?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie positioned her hands, gripping the ball. <span class="dialogue">"Ready!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Toss!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">The ball flew up. Mum eased off the accelerator smoothly, and the car began to slow. The ball
      arced upward, traced its path... and dropped onto the seat in front of Cassie, just as she'd predicted!</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"I was right!"</span> Cassie squealed. <span class="dialogue">"The ball
        went ahead of us!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb bounced in his seat. <span class="dialogue">"My turn! What if you go faster?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"What do you think will happen, Caleb?"</span> Mum asked, speeding back
      up carefully.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"The ball will land behind us!"</span> he crowed. <span
        class="dialogue">"'Cause we'll be faster than the ball!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Let's find out! Cassie, toss it one more time, and I'll speed up just
        a little bit."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie threw the ball. Mum pressed gently on the accelerator. The car surged forward just
      slightly, and the ball—carrying only the original speed—fell short of Cassie's hands, landing exactly where Caleb
      had predicted.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"We're scientists!"</span> Caleb declared proudly.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"You absolutely are,"</span> Mum agreed warmly. <span
        class="dialogue">"You made predictions, tested them with experiments, and learned about relative motion and
        speed. Now remember, we only did this special experiment because I said it was safe today. Never play with toys
        in a moving car unless a grown-up says it's okay for a special reason like learning science!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Both children nodded seriously.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Do you know what's amazing?"</span> Mum continued. <span
        class="dialogue">"Everything we've talked about today—how things move, why things fall, why motion looks
        different depending on where you're standing—all of these things were explained by one very curious person, just
        like you."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Through the windshield, Cassie could now see glimpses of blue between the buildings—the ocean!
      They were almost there!</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"His name was Sir Isaac Newton,"</span> Mum continued. <span
        class="dialogue">"He was born over three hundred years ago in England, but the discoveries he made still help us
        understand the world today. And you know what? Many other scientists from all over the world—from every culture
        and continent—have contributed to our understanding of motion and gravity too!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Was Newton a grown-up scientist?"</span> Cassie asked.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Eventually, yes. But before he was a grown-up, he was a child just
        like you—maybe even more curious! Everyone around him noticed that things fell to the ground. People saw apples
        drop from trees every autumn for thousands and thousands of years. But it was Isaac Newton who got really
        curious about why. He asked questions, he experimented, he thought hard about the world around him."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">The car slowed as they approached a traffic light. Mum looked at both children in the rearview
      mirror, her eyes warm with love and pride.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"People noticed that when you're traveling, things outside seem to move
        past you. But it was Isaac Newton who carefully studied these observations and explained the mathematics and
        physics behind it all. He didn't have any superpowers—he just had curiosity, patience, and a love of learning,
        like you two."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Did he say anything cool?"</span> Cassie asked.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"He said many cool things! But one of my favorites is this: 'If others
        would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.' <span class="question">Do you understand
          what that means?</span>"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie thought about it. <span class="dialogue">"He's saying... he wasn't magic or super
        special. He just thought really hard about things?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Exactly! He's saying that anyone who asks questions, who thinks
        deeply, who stays curious and works hard to understand things—anyone can make discoveries and learn wonderful
        things. People of all ages, from all backgrounds, in all countries can be scientists!"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">The light turned green, and they pulled forward. The salt smell of the ocean was drifting
      through the air vents now, mixing with the coconut air freshener.</p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Another great scientist, Albert Einstein, said something similar. He
        said, 'I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.'"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"Passionately curious,"</span> Cassie repeated. <span
        class="dialogue">"That's like being really, really, really curious?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"The most curious you can possibly be! And you know what? That's
        exactly what you two are. You don't just notice things—you wonder about them. You ask questions. You think hard
        about the answers. You're wearing your curious caps today, and I hope you wear them every single day."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">Caleb reached up and patted his head, as if checking for an invisible cap. <span
        class="dialogue">"Is my curious cap on?"</span></p>

    <p class="story-text"><span class="dialogue">"It's on perfectly,"</span> Mum assured him. <span
        class="dialogue">"And remember, being curious means asking questions, being patient while we learn, and being
        kind to others while they're learning too."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Through the windows, Cassie could now see the beach properly—the wide expanse of golden sand,
      the blue-green waves rolling in, the white foam of surf, the distant figures of people swimming and playing.
      They'd made it! Ten kilometers, approximately ten minutes (with some traffic delays), and countless discoveries
      later.</p>

    <p class="story-text">Mum pulled into a parking spot and turned off the engine. But before anyone unbuckled, both
      children started singing spontaneously, their voices harmonizing in joyful anticipation:</p>

    <div class="poem-box">
      <p class="poem-verse">Let's go marching to the shore,<br />
        Let's discover so much more!<br />

    <p class="story-text">They continued, their voices rising with excitement:</p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie took a breath and concluded:</p>

      <p class="poem-verse">Science helps us understand,<br />

        in place! And remember what we learned about staying safe—always stay where I can see you, and never go in the
        water without me right beside you."</span></p>

    <p class="story-text">Cassie stepped out onto the warm pavement, her mind full of gravity and relative motion and
      walking palm trees and all the mysteries yet to be discovered. The beach stretched before them, full of
      possibilities.</p>

    <p class="story-text">The world, she realized, was full of questions waiting to be asked. And she couldn't wait to
      ask them all—with patience, kindness, and endless curiosity.</p>
