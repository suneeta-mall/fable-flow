Curious Cassie’s beach ride quest: A Celebration of Isaac Newton’s Discoveries

# Synopsis
Cassie is a curious 6-year-old kid. She loves thinking and asking interesting questions. Her mum is calling upon Cassie and Caleb (Cassie’s 3-year-old brother) to get ready as they are heading to Cronulla Beach for an adventurous day. Thinking about “going”, Cassie wonders why people can move but not the trees". Her mum explains the mechanism of movement and tells them a fun fact about the “walking palm” - a special tree that can move. As they discuss how the walking-palm moves, they encounter interesting phenomena sparking curiosity about gravity. Mum helps them feel gravity through bunny hops. They are very excited about everything they just discussed and began to drive to the beach.

In the car, Caleb is impatient and keeps interrupting to find out when they will arrive at the beach. Mum takes Caleb’s impatience as an opportunity to explain to the kids the concepts of distance, time, and speed using fun references. Mum explains to the kids how to extrapolate the distance and estimated time. Curious Cassie does skip counts to help Caleb with the estimated arrival time to calm him down.

Cassie is now wondering why she feels that all the roadside trees and bushes are running backward when as a matter of fact, she is moving. Mum uses this observation to explain the concept of relative speeds. She encourages the kids to do an experiment suggesting tossing the ball up in the air and asking where the ball would fall. The kids are thrilled as they realise the ball can fall ahead, behind, or straight in their lap depending on the speed of the car after the ball is thrown. Mum then tells them that all the fun things they have learned today were explained by Sir Issac Newton. She underscores the importance of being curious and encourages them to continue pursuing their curiosity quest.
