# Cassie, Caleb, and the Magic of YET

## A Growth Mindset Adventure

---

## Chapter 1: The Question That Changed Everything

Cassie was seven years old when she discovered the most important question in the world.

It happened on a rainy Tuesday. She'd come home from school with her math worksheet crumpled in her backpack, hidden under her lunchbox so Mom wouldn't see. Three problems had big red X's on them.

"I'm stupid," she whispered to herself in the bathroom mirror. The words felt true and heavy, like stones in her stomach.

At dinner, Dad noticed she was quiet. "Rough day?"

Cassie shrugged. "I got math problems wrong. Maya got them all right. She's smart and I'm not."

Dad set down his fork. "Can I tell you something that changed my whole life when I was your age?"

Cassie looked up.

"My grandmother asked me a question once, when I was frustrated about not being able to ride horses like my cousin. She said, 'Are you saying you *can't* do it, or that you can't do it *yet*?'"

"What's the difference?" Cassie asked.

"That's what I asked her. And she said: '*Can't* is a wall. *Yet* is a door. When you say 'I can't,' you're telling your brain the story is over. When you say 'I can't yet,' you're telling your brain the story is still being written.'"

Four-year-old Caleb looked up from smashing his peas. "I can't fly yet!"

Everyone laughed.

"Well," Mom said, smiling, "some things might stay 'yet' forever. But the beautiful thing is, you never really know which ones until you try."

That night, Cassie lay in bed thinking. She'd always believed people were either smart or not smart, good at things or bad at things. Like sorting laundry: whites and colors, no in-between.

But what if that wasn't true?

She pulled out her crumpled math worksheet and looked at it differently. Not as proof she was stupid, but as a map showing her exactly what she didn't understand *yet*.

It was a small shift. But small shifts can move mountains.

## Chapter 2: Cassie's Wobbly Wheels
*On staying open when you think you already know*

The purple bicycle appeared in the garage on Saturday morning. No training wheels. Just two thin tires and a world of possibility.

Cassie grinned. She was the fastest scooter rider on the block—everyone said so. She could zoom down hills, make sharp turns, and stop on a dime. A bicycle? Easy. It was basically a scooter with pedals.

"Want me to help you get started?" Mom offered.

"No thanks," Cassie said confidently. "I've got this. I'm really good at scootering, so this should be the same."

Mom and Dad exchanged a look but stepped back.

Cassie climbed onto the bike the way she'd hop onto her scooter—one foot on, push off, swing the other leg over. But the bike wobbled wildly and she tumbled onto the lawn before she'd gone two feet.

*Okay,* she thought. *Just need to push off harder.*

She tried again, this time giving a big strong push with her foot like she did on the scooter. The bike shot forward, she lost her balance completely, and crashed sideways into the grass.

"Ow!"

She got up, frowning. On a scooter, you kept one foot on the deck and pushed with the other. You steered by leaning. You balanced over a wide platform. She tried doing all of this on the bike—leaning into turns, keeping her weight the way she did on the scooter.

Crash. Crash. Crash.

By her seventh attempt, Cassie's knee was scraped, her palms were grass-stained, and she was furious.

"This is STUPID!" she shouted, throwing her helmet. "I'm good at scootering! Why isn't this WORKING?"

From the porch, Dad called out, "Can I come sit with you?"

"I don't need help! I KNOW how to do this!"

Dad walked over anyway and sat on the grass a few feet away, saying nothing. Just sat there.

After a while, Cassie's breathing slowed. "I don't understand," she said, her voice small and frustrated. "I'm good at balancing. I'm good at steering. I'm good at going fast. Why can't I do this?"

"Can I ask you something?" Dad said gently. "What have you been trying?"

"Everything I know from scootering! Pushing off with one foot. Leaning to steer. Keeping my weight centered. It works perfectly on my scooter!"

"Ahh," Dad said. "I think I see what's happening. You came to the bike expecting it to be like the scooter. So you've been trying to make the bike act like a scooter."

"Well... yeah. They're both things with wheels that you ride."

"They are. But they work differently. On a scooter, you balance over a wide platform, you push with your foot, and you steer by leaning your body. On a bike, you balance over a narrow seat, you push with pedals in a circle, and you steer mostly with the handlebars. The skills look similar, but they're actually quite different."

Cassie stared at the bike. She hadn't thought about that. She'd just assumed her scooter skills would transfer over automatically.

"Here's something important about learning," Dad continued. "Sometimes the hardest person to teach is someone who thinks they already know. Not because they're not smart—but because they're not *open*. They're so busy applying what they already know that they can't see what's actually in front of them."

"But I AM smart at riding things!"

"You are! You're great at scootering. But being great at one thing can sometimes make it harder to learn a related thing—because you assume it'll be the same, and you stop paying attention to what's actually happening."

Cassie thought about this. "So... my scooter skills were getting in the way?"

"Not the skills themselves—your *assumptions* about them. You assumed the bike would work like the scooter. When it didn't, you didn't adjust. You just kept trying the same scooter approach harder and harder."

"What should I have done?"

"Noticed. When you fell the first time, instead of thinking 'push harder,' you could have thought, 'Hmm, that didn't work. What's different about this bike? What is it asking me to do?' Observation instead of assumption."

Dad paused. "And there's something else. When you're learning something genuinely new, even if it looks similar to something you know, it helps to have a guide. Someone who can see what you can't see because you're too close to it."

Cassie wiped her nose. She thought about how she'd refused Mom's help because she was so sure she already knew.

"I think... I was so confident that I stopped being curious," she said slowly. "I thought I knew the answer, so I didn't look for a new one."

"That's a really wise observation, sweetheart. The best learners aren't people who know everything. They're people who stay open—even when they think they already know. *Especially* when they think they already know."

Mom walked over with two glasses of lemonade. "Ready to try together? I can point out some things that might help."

Cassie looked at the bike. Then at her parents. She took a breath and let go of her certainty.

"Okay. But... tell me what you see? I think I've been missing stuff."

Mom held the back of the seat and pointed things out as Cassie tried again. "See how you're leaning your whole body? On a bike, try keeping your body more upright and steering with the handlebars instead. And when you pedal, it's a smooth circle, not a push-and-coast like a scooter."

It felt completely different from scootering. Cassie had to let go of her scooter instincts and actually feel what the *bike* wanted.

After a few more tries, she made it ten feet.

"That was so different!" she breathed. "I was doing it all wrong before—not because I'm bad at riding, but because I was riding the wrong way for this thing."

"Exactly," Dad said. "Your scooter skills aren't useless—you've got great balance, quick reflexes, confidence at speed. Those will all help eventually. But first you had to stop assuming and start observing. You had to be a beginner again, even though part of you already felt like an expert."

Over the next two weeks, Cassie learned to ride the bike—really ride it. She noticed that some scooter skills did transfer once she understood the differences. Her balance helped. Her confidence helped. But she'd had to let go of her assumptions first to see what actually worked.

The hardest part wasn't learning to ride a bike. It was learning to stay open when she thought she already knew.

## Chapter 3: The Tower That Kept Falling
*On embracing mistakes as teachers*

Caleb's block tower crashed for the eighth time, and he did what any self-respecting four-year-old would do: he screamed.

"I HATE BLOCKS! I HATE TOWERS! I HATE EVERYTHING!"

He swept his arm across the remaining blocks, scattering them across the playroom floor. Then he threw himself face-down on the carpet and cried.

Mom sat down nearby and waited. She didn't say anything. Didn't try to fix it or make it better. Just sat.

Eventually, Caleb's crying turned to hiccups. He rolled over and looked at her.

"I'm really mad," he said.

"I can see that. It's frustrating when something keeps not working."

"It falls down EVERY TIME."

"Mmm. And when it falls, how do you feel?"

Caleb thought. "Mad. And... embarrassed."

"Embarrassed? Why?"

"Because I'm supposed to be able to do it and I CAN'T."

Mom nodded slowly. "Caleb, I want to tell you something really important. Can you listen with your whole body?"

Caleb sat up and crossed his legs. Listening with his whole body meant sitting still and looking at the person talking.

"Mistakes and failures aren't signs that something is wrong with you. They're messages. They're your tower's way of talking to you."

"Towers can't talk," Caleb said.

"Not with words. But every time it falls, it's giving you information. It's saying, 'Try something different here.' The falling IS the lesson."

Caleb looked at the scattered blocks. "So... the tower is teaching me?"

"Exactly. And here's something else: the kids who learn the most aren't the ones whose towers never fall. They're the ones who pay attention when they fall and ask, 'What is this telling me?'"

Cassie wandered in with a book and sat down, listening.

Mom continued, "A scientist named Dr. Carol Dweck discovered something amazing. When she studied people who became really skilled at things, she found they thought about mistakes completely differently than other people. They didn't see mistakes as failures. They saw them as clues."

"Like detectives?" Caleb asked, perking up.

"Exactly like detectives. Every mistake is evidence. Evidence that helps you solve the mystery of how to do something."

Caleb looked at the blocks scattered around him with new eyes. "So when my tower fell... it was giving me a clue?"

"What do you think the clue was?"

Caleb picked up a block and studied it. "Maybe... the bottom wasn't big enough? It was wobbly."

"That's a hypothesis! A scientist's guess. Want to test it?"

Caleb started building again, but this time with a wider base. The tower was more stable. He got to six blocks before it wobbled and fell.

But this time, he didn't scream. He looked at the fallen blocks thoughtfully.

"Hmm," he said. "That big block on top was too heavy. I should put small ones up high."

Mom smiled. "You're learning to listen to your mistakes."

Twenty minutes later, Caleb had built a tower twelve blocks high. But more importantly, he'd stopped fearing the crashes. Each one was just another clue.

"Mom?" he asked. "Is it weird that I kind of like when it falls now? Because then I get to figure out why?"

"That's not weird at all," Mom said. "That's called being curious. And curiosity is the engine that drives all learning."

## Chapter 4: The Swimming Secret
*On letting go and trusting the process*

"I'll sink," Cassie said, standing in the shallow end where the water came up to her waist. "I just know I'll sink."

This was her third swimming lesson, and she still hadn't put her face in the water. Every time she tried, panic grabbed her throat and she jerked back up.

The other kids were already doing bobs, dipping under and coming back up like it was nothing. Cassie felt like a failure.

Miss Rosa waded over and stood right beside her. "Let's take a little break from trying. Can I tell you something I've noticed?"

Cassie nodded, shivering despite the warm air.

"You're trying really hard to control everything. Your muscles are tight. You're holding your breath before you even touch the water. You're trying to make your body do something while also fighting against it."

"I don't understand."

"Learning to swim is different from a lot of other learning. It's not about trying harder. It's about trying *softer*."

"That doesn't make sense."

"I know. It's strange, isn't it? Most things in life—riding bikes, building towers, learning math—you get better by putting in more effort. But swimming asks you to do the opposite. It asks you to relax your body. To stop clenching. To let your muscles soften so they can learn new movements."

Miss Rosa demonstrated, letting her shoulders drop and her arms go loose. "See? When I'm all tense"—she stiffened up—"my body fights itself. When I relax"—she softened again—"I can move the way water wants me to move."

"But what if I go underwater?"

"That's why we practice here in the shallow end, where you can always put your feet down and stand up. I'm right here with you—close enough to touch. And Mr. James is watching from the lifeguard chair. You're learning inside a safe container, so you can practice relaxing without real danger."

Cassie looked around. Miss Rosa was inches away. The lifeguard was watching. Her feet were firmly on the pool floor.

"Now, here's a trick for when you put your face in," Miss Rosa continued. "Hum a little tune. Like this: hmmmm. The humming keeps water from going up your nose because air is coming out. Want to practice above water first?"

They hummed together. Then Miss Rosa showed her how to take a breath, start humming, and dip just her face in for one second.

"I'll be right here. You can stand up the moment you want to."

Cassie's heart pounded. But Miss Rosa was so close. And the water was so shallow. And she could stand up anytime.

She took a breath. Started humming. Dipped her face in—

The water was cool against her skin. She felt her feet solid on the pool floor. The humming buzzed in her ears.

She came back up, gasping.

"I did it!" she sputtered.

"You did! How did it feel?"

"Scary at first. But then... I stopped clenching so hard and it was easier."

"That's exactly it. You let go of fighting, and your body could finally learn."

That night, Cassie told her parents what Miss Rosa said.

Mom nodded thoughtfully. "She's right, you know. Some of the most important learning in life isn't about adding more—more effort, more control, more certainty. It's about softening."

"Like what?"

"Like learning to fall asleep. Remember when you were little and you'd try so hard to sleep that you'd stay awake? The trying was the problem. You had to relax and let sleep come."

"Or making friends," Dad added. "You can't force someone to like you. You have to relax, be yourself, and let the connection happen naturally. Gripping too tight pushes people away."

"It feels really scary," Cassie admitted. "Letting go of control."

"It is scary," Mom agreed. "But here's the thing—when you grip too tightly, you actually block the very thing you're trying to achieve. A clenched hand can't receive anything. An open hand can."

"Miss Rosa said swimming is about relaxing your muscles so they can learn new movements," Cassie said. "And she kept me in the shallow water where I could always stand up, so it was safe to practice relaxing."

"That's good teaching," Dad said. "She created safety around you so you could practice letting go inside that safety. That's different from being reckless. It's controlled practice."

Cassie thought about this. "So I'm not letting go of *safety*. I'm letting go of *clenching*. Inside the safe place."

"Exactly. The shallow water, the instructor beside you, the lifeguard watching—those stay. What goes is the tight muscles and the fighting against yourself."

At her next lesson, Cassie put her face in the water five times. Each time, she practiced relaxing her shoulders, softening her grip on the pool edge, letting her body learn instead of forcing it.

It wasn't about being careless. It was about releasing the tension that blocked learning, while staying inside the safe container Miss Rosa had created.

And slowly, breath by breath, Cassie's body began to understand water in a new way—not as an enemy to fight, but as an element to learn, one gentle step at a time.

## Chapter 5: The Question Jar
*On staying curious instead of needing to be right*

Dad came home one day with a glass jar and a pad of sticky notes.

"What's that for?" Caleb asked.

"This is our new family Question Jar. Every time any of us has a question we don't know the answer to, we write it down and put it in the jar."

"Why?" Cassie asked.

"Because I've noticed something in our family. When we don't know something, we sometimes feel embarrassed. We pretend we know, or we change the subject, or we get frustrated. But not knowing things is actually wonderful—it means we have something new to discover."

Mom added, "We want to celebrate questions, not just answers. Questions are how our minds grow."

That evening, they started.

Caleb wrote (with Mom's help): "Why is the sky blue?"  
Cassie wrote: "How do airplanes stay up?"  
Mom wrote: "Why do some plants grow toward light?"  
Dad wrote: "How do ants know where to find food?"

They put all the questions in the jar and shook it up.

"Now," Dad said, "every Sunday we'll pick one question, and we'll explore it together. We'll look things up, ask people, experiment if we can. The goal isn't to become experts. It's to stay curious."

That first Sunday, they pulled out: "How do airplanes stay up?"

"I actually thought I knew this," Dad admitted. "But when I really think about it... I'm not sure I understand it well."

"Me neither," Mom said. "Should we find out together?"

They watched videos about lift and air pressure. They made paper airplanes and tested different designs. Cassie was surprised to see her parents genuinely curious, asking questions, admitting when they didn't understand something.

"Wait," Mom said at one point, "I still don't get how the curved wing creates lower pressure. Can we watch that part again?"

"Me neither," Dad said. "This is harder than I thought!"

Cassie watched them rewind the video, discuss it, get confused, try again. These were her grown-up parents—and they didn't know everything. And they were *okay* with that.

"Dad," she said later, "were you embarrassed when you didn't understand the airplane stuff?"

"A little," he admitted. "But I've learned that admitting what I don't know is one of the most powerful things I can do. It opens doors. Pretending to know keeps them closed."

"But at school, everyone acts like not knowing is bad. The kids who know answers fastest get the most stars."

"That's true, and it can send the wrong message. Knowing things is valuable, but so is being willing to sit in the not-knowing and explore. Some of the smartest people in history were the ones who asked the most questions, not the ones who had all the answers."

The Question Jar became one of the family's favorite traditions. Weeks later, it was stuffed with sticky notes:

*Why do we dream?*  
*What makes thunder?*  
*Where does the sun go at night?*  
*Why do I like some foods and not others?*  
*How do caterpillars turn into butterflies?*

And the most interesting part? The more questions they asked, the more they realized how much there was to learn. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, it felt exciting—like they were surrounded by treasures waiting to be discovered.

"I think my favorite thing," Mom said one evening, "is that we don't have to know everything. We just have to be curious enough to keep asking."

## Chapter 6: The Recital and the Rain
*On effort, resilience, and finding meaning in the journey*

Cassie practiced piano for the spring recital every day for six weeks. The piece was "Für Elise"—just the first part, but still the hardest thing she'd ever played.

Some days, her fingers remembered every note. Other days, they stumbled like they'd never touched the keys before. She felt like she was making progress, then losing it, then making progress again.

"Why isn't it getting easier?" she asked Mom one frustrating afternoon.

"Learning isn't always a straight line upward," Mom explained. "Sometimes it's more like a messy scribble. You go forward, then back, then sideways, then forward again. But if you zoom out, you can see the overall direction."

The night before the recital, Cassie couldn't sleep. What if she forgot the notes? What if everyone laughed? What if she messed up in front of the whole audience?

"Dad?" she called out. "I can't sleep."

Dad came and sat on the edge of her bed. "Big day tomorrow. Nervous?"

"Really nervous. What if I make a mistake?"

"You might. Actually, you probably will—most performers make small mistakes. The audience usually doesn't even notice."

"But I'll notice."

"Maybe. And then you'll keep playing. That's what resilience is—not avoiding the hard things, but moving through them. A mistake in a recital isn't the end of the story. It's just a sentence in the middle."

"What if I freeze up completely and can't play at all?"

Dad thought for a moment. "Do you remember why you wanted to learn this piece?"

Cassie had to think back. "Because it's so pretty. When I heard it, I thought, 'I want to make that sound.' And I wanted to surprise Grandma because it's her favorite."

"So the recital isn't really about being perfect. It's about sharing something beautiful with people you love, including yourself. Does that change how it feels?"

Cassie considered this. "A little. It's still scary though."

"It's okay to be scared and to do it anyway. That's basically the definition of courage."

The next day, the recital went... imperfectly. Cassie's hands trembled at the start. She played one wrong note in the second section. At one point, she lost her place for a heart-stopping second before finding it again.

But she kept playing. And when she finished, the audience clapped. Grandma was wiping her eyes.

"That was beautiful, sweetheart," Grandma said afterward, hugging her tight. "I could feel how much you cared about every note."

Later, at home, Cassie sat with Mom reviewing how it went.

"I made mistakes," Cassie said.

"Yes. How do you feel about them?"

Cassie thought. "I thought I'd feel terrible. But actually... I feel proud? I kept going. And the mistakes didn't ruin everything. They were just moments."

"That's a big realization. Mistakes aren't the opposite of success. They're part of it. Every musician, every artist, every athlete, every person who does anything hard in public makes mistakes. What matters is how you relate to them."

"What do you mean?"

"You can see mistakes as evidence that you're not good enough—that's a fixed mindset. Or you can see them as natural, temporary, and something to learn from—that's growth mindset. Same mistakes, completely different meaning depending on how you look at them."

Cassie thought about this for a long time. "I think... I think I used to believe that if I made a mistake, it meant I was bad. But now I think it just means I'm human. And learning. And trying."

"That's wisdom," Mom said softly. "Real wisdom."

## Chapter 7: Caleb Teaches the Teacher
*On how everyone has something to learn and something to teach*

One afternoon, Caleb was playing in the backyard when the elderly neighbor, Mr. Patterson, came outside to garden. Mr. Patterson walked with a cane and moved slowly. He'd lived next door for thirty years.

"Whatcha doing?" Caleb asked through the fence.

"Trying to plant these tomatoes," Mr. Patterson said, "but my back isn't cooperating today."

Caleb was quiet, then asked: "Do you want help? I'm really good at digging."

Mr. Patterson looked surprised. "Well, I suppose that would be nice."

Mom watched from the window as Caleb squeezed through the fence gate and got to work. He dug little holes while Mr. Patterson directed him. Caleb chatted the whole time—about dinosaurs, about his tower-building skills, about how caterpillars turn into butterflies.

Mr. Patterson, who usually kept to himself, was smiling.

An hour later, Caleb came home with dirt under his fingernails and something exciting to share.

"Mom! Mr. Patterson taught me about roots! Did you know plants drink through their roots like straws? And he showed me a worm! He said worms are good for the garden because they make the soil healthy. And he called me his 'apprentice'—that means I'm learning from a master!"

"That's wonderful, honey. Did you teach him anything?"

Caleb looked surprised. "Me? Teach a grown-up?"

"Why not? You know lots of things he might not know."

Caleb thought hard. "Well... I told him about Brachiosaurus. He didn't know that they ate plants! And I showed him how to make a whistle with a blade of grass. He couldn't do it though—he said his lips don't work like they used to."

Mom knelt down. "See? You taught him and he taught you. Learning isn't just something kids do from adults. It goes every direction."

"Even grown-ups learn from kids?"

"Absolutely. I learn from you and Cassie all the time. You remind me to be curious. To ask questions. To be excited about simple things. Adults sometimes forget how to do those things, and kids help us remember."

At dinner that night, Cassie asked about Mr. Patterson.

"He's really nice," Caleb said. "He knows SO much about plants. But he said his hands shake now and it's hard to garden. He seemed sad about it."

"Getting older is its own kind of challenge," Dad said. "Mr. Patterson is probably learning new things about his body and what it can do—just like you learn about yours."

"So he's still learning? Even though he's old?"

"Learning never stops. We just learn different things at different ages. When you're young, you're learning to walk, talk, read, and ride bikes. When you're older, you might be learning how to do your job better, or how to be a good parent, or how to handle disappointment. When you're very old, you might be learning how to adapt when your body doesn't work the way it used to."

Cassie said, "So everybody is learning something. All the time."

"All the time. And everybody has something to teach, too. Mr. Patterson knows about gardens. Caleb knows about dinosaurs. You know about piano and bike riding. Your teacher knows about reading and math. I know about cooking and fixing things. Mom knows about stories and animals. We're all experts in something and beginners in something else."

"That's kind of nice," Cassie said. "It means we need each other."

"Exactly. We're all teachers and students at the same time. That's what makes a community work."

The next weekend, Caleb helped Mr. Patterson again. This time, he brought a drawing he'd made of Mr. Patterson's garden, with all the plants labeled.

Mr. Patterson hung it on his refrigerator.

"Best gift I've gotten in years," he said, his voice a little thick.

Caleb beamed. He was learning about roots and worms and patience. But he was also learning something bigger: that connection happens when people share what they know with open hearts.

## Chapter 8: The Summer of Yet

As summer began, the family sat together to plan their "Summer of Yet."

"I want everyone to pick something they can't do yet," Mom said. "Something that feels a little out of reach. We'll work on them together, and at the end of summer, we'll see how far we've come."

Cassie chose: cartwheels.  
Caleb chose: tying his shoes.  
Mom chose: playing ukulele.  
Dad chose: speaking Spanish (enough to order food in Mexico, at least).

They made a chart and hung it on the refrigerator.

**Week One** was full of enthusiasm. Cassie practiced cartwheels until she was dizzy. Caleb tangled his shoelaces into impossible knots. Mom's ukulele made sounds like a cat in distress. Dad's Spanish pronunciation made everyone giggle.

**Week Two** was full of frustration. Cassie's cartwheels still looked like controlled falls. Caleb declared shoelaces "the worst invention ever." Mom's fingers hurt so much she wanted to quit. Dad couldn't remember the difference between "pollo" and "pelo."

They had a family meeting.

"This is harder than I thought," Mom admitted. "My fingers are sore, and I feel like I'm not getting anywhere."

"Me too with cartwheels," Cassie said. "I'm starting to wonder if I can even do this."

"This is the messy middle," Dad said. "Remember? The place between starting and getting good. It's where most people quit."

"What keeps people going?" Caleb asked.

Mom thought about it. "Remembering why we started. I wanted to learn ukulele because my grandmother played, and I want to feel connected to her. When I remember that, the sore fingers feel worth it."

"And celebrating small progress," Dad added. "Yesterday I ordered coffee in Spanish in my head and got all the words right. That's not nothing."

They decided to focus less on the end goal and more on daily tiny wins. Did you practice today? That's a win. Did you learn one new thing? That's a win. Did you try even when you didn't feel like it? That's a win.

**Week Five** brought breakthroughs. Cassie's cartwheels weren't perfect, but her legs were going over her head. Caleb could tie a basic knot (bunny ears were still confusing). Mom could play "Twinkle Twinkle" slowly but recognizably. Dad could introduce himself and order food.

**Week Eight**—end of summer.

Cassie did a cartwheel across the backyard. Wobbly, bent legs, but recognizably a cartwheel.

Caleb tied his shoes—slowly, with concentration—but by himself.

Mom played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" well enough that Caleb clapped.

Dad ordered dinner at a Mexican restaurant entirely in Spanish. The waiter smiled and answered back in Spanish, and Dad actually understood most of it.

At their celebration dinner, they reflected on what they'd learned.

"The thing that surprised me most," Mom said, "was how many times I wanted to quit. Not because it was too hard, but because progress felt so slow. I had to keep reminding myself that slow progress is still progress."

"I learned that I'm not patient," Caleb said honestly. "But I can get more patient if I practice. Is patience a skill?"

"It absolutely is," Dad said. "And you just named something important. We don't just learn cartwheels and Spanish. We learn patience, persistence, how to handle frustration, how to keep going when we want to stop. Those skills matter just as much."

Cassie looked at the chart on the refrigerator, filled with check marks and notes. "I don't think I'll ever look at 'I can't' the same way again. Now when I hear it in my head, another voice says, 'Yet.'"

"That voice will serve you your whole life," Mom said. "Learning never ends. There will always be new 'yets' waiting for you."

## Chapter 9: The Gift of Yet

The last week of summer, Cassie noticed a girl about her age at the park, standing at the edge of the playground looking uncomfortable.

"Hi," Cassie said, walking over. "I'm Cassie."

"I'm Nadia. I just moved here."

"Want to play?"

They climbed on the jungle gym together. When they reached the monkey bars, Nadia stopped.

"I can't do those," she said, backing away.

Cassie almost said, "They're easy!" But she stopped herself. She remembered being terrified of the fourth bar. She remembered all the times she'd fallen and how much she'd hated it when people made it sound simple.

"I couldn't do them either, at first," Cassie said instead. "Want me to tell you what helped me?"

Nadia looked uncertain. "Okay..."

"My dad told me that being scared doesn't mean you can't do it. It just means you care about trying. And my swimming teacher said sometimes you have to let go of needing to control everything and just... trust."

"Trust what?"

"The process, I guess? And your body. And that even if you fall, you'll be okay."

Nadia reached for the first bar. She hung there for a second, then dropped down.

"I only made it one bar," she said, disappointed.

"One bar is one bar more than zero bars," Cassie said. "That's how I think about it now. Tomorrow you might make it to two. Or you might still make it to one. Both are okay."

Nadia looked at her. "You're nice. Most people just say 'it's easy' and that makes me feel worse."

"It's not easy. It's hard. But you can't do it *yet*. That's different from never."

They played until the sun started setting. Before Nadia's mom called her to leave, she said, "Thanks for the 'yet' thing. I'm going to try to remember it."

Walking home, Cassie felt warm inside. Not because she'd done something impressive, but because she'd shared something that helped.

That night, she told her family about Nadia.

"You gave her a gift," Mom said. "The gift of yet. It doesn't cost anything, but it can change someone's whole way of seeing themselves."

"Do you think she'll remember it?"

"Maybe. Maybe she'll forget and need to be reminded someday. That's okay too. We all need reminders. The important thing is that seeds get planted."

Dad added, "You know what's funny? Teaching someone about growth mindset is one of the best ways to strengthen your own. When you explain something, you understand it better yourself."

Cassie thought about all the things she'd learned this summer. Bike riding and cartwheels, yes. But also: asking for help isn't weakness. Mistakes are teachers. Everyone has something to learn and something to teach. Curiosity is more valuable than certainty. Letting go can be as important as trying harder. And *yet* changes everything.

"I think," she said slowly, "that growth mindset isn't just about getting better at stuff. It's about... becoming a different kind of person. More open. More curious. Less afraid."

Her parents exchanged a look.

"Cassie," Dad said, "that might be the wisest thing I've heard all summer."

## A Note for Young Readers

Dear Reader,

The ideas in this story are inspired by real scientific research by **Dr. Carol Dweck** and many others who study how our minds work.

Here's what they've discovered:

**Your brain changes when you learn.** It actually grows new connections. Every time you practice, struggle, and try again, you're literally building your brain.

**Mistakes are how we learn.** Not a sign of failure—information. Clues. Data. The best learners don't avoid mistakes; they pay attention to them.

**Asking for help is smart, not weak.** The most successful people in the world have coaches, mentors, and teams. They know that learning with others is faster and richer than learning alone.

**Everyone is both a teacher and a student.** You have knowledge that others need, and they have knowledge you need. Life is an exchange.

**Sometimes learning means letting go.** Not everything responds to trying harder. Sometimes you need to relax, trust, and allow learning to happen.

**Yet is a magic word.** It takes "I can't" and opens it up. It reminds you that today isn't forever.

You are capable of amazing growth. Not because everything will be easy, but because you can learn to work with hard things instead of against them.

Keep being curious. Keep asking questions. Keep saying *yet*.
