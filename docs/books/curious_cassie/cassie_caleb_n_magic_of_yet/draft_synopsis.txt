# Cassie, Caleb, and the Magic of YET
## A Growth Mindset Adventure

## Synopsis

What if one tiny word could change everything?

When seven-year-old Cassie comes home with a crumpled math test hidden in her backpack, she whispers the words many kids think: "I'm stupid." But Dad shares a secret his grandmother taught him—the magic difference between "I can't" and "I can't YET."

Follow Cassie and her little brother Caleb on an adventure of wobbly bicycles, crashing block towers, scary swimming lessons, and a piano recital that doesn't go perfectly. They discover that mistakes aren't failures—they're clues! That asking for help makes you smarter, not weaker. And that everyone, from kids to grandparents, is both a teacher and a student.

This heartwarming story shows young readers that their brains can grow, change, and get stronger with every challenge they face.

## Featured Scientist: Dr. Carol Dweck

**Who is she?** Dr. Carol Dweck is a real scientist at Stanford University who studies how kids (and grown-ups!) learn.

**What did she discover?** Dr. Dweck found something amazing: when you believe your brain can grow stronger with practice, it actually does! She calls this having a "growth mindset."

**Her big idea:** There are two ways to think:
- "I can't do this" (Fixed Mindset) = Your story is over
- "I can't do this YET" (Growth Mindset) = Your story is still being written!

Her research proves that every time you try hard things, your brain builds new connections—like making trails through a forest that get clearer each time you walk them.

## Inspiration

Every child faces moments when they feel "not good enough." Maybe it's a math problem they can't solve, a bike they can't ride, or a friend who seems to learn faster.

This book was created to give children a superpower: the knowledge that struggling means their brain is growing. Dr. Dweck's real science shows that the kids who succeed aren't the ones who never fail—they're the ones who see mistakes as clues and keep trying.

Through Cassie and Caleb's adventures, young readers learn:
- Your brain is like a muscle—it gets stronger when you use it
- Mistakes are your teachers, not your enemies
- The "messy middle" (when learning feels hardest) is where the magic happens
- Asking for help is brave, not weak
- Everyone you meet knows something you don't—and you know something they don't!
