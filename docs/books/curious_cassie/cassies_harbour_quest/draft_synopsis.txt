Curious Cassie's Harbour Quest: A Discovery of Marine Science and Buoyancy

# Synopsis
Cassie is a curious six-year-old who loves asking questions and doing experiments. When her family heads to Sydney Harbour for a surprise fishing trip, she discovers that science is everywhere—from the chocolate cake in her kitchen to the creatures hiding in rock pools!
Join Cassie and her little brother Caleb as they learn why mud cake is denser than sponge cake, how fish breathe underwater, what makes boats float, and why some animals are masters of disguise. Along the way, they meet sideways-walking crabs, water-powered sea stars, and fish with tiny balloons inside their bellies!
Packed with hands-on experiments, catchy songs, and real science inspired by Australian marine biologist Professor Emma Johnston, this adventure will spark curiosity in young readers and prove that the best discoveries begin with a simple question: "But why?"
