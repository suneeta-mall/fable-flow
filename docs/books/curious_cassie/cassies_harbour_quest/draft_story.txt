# Curious Cassie's Harbour Quest
## A Discovery of Marine Science and Buoyancy

### Chapter 1: One Too Many Experiments

Cassie is a curious six-year-old who loves thinking and asking interesting questions. Today, she and her three-year-old brother Caleb have just finished their favourite experiment—exploding volcanoes!

Do you know what an exploding volcano experiment is? Here's how Cassie and Caleb do it: They take a cup and pour in vinegar until it's half full. Then they add glitter, orange food colouring, and a few drops of dish soap, mixing it all together with a spoon. But the most exciting part? Adding a spoonful of bicarbonate soda! Cassie and Caleb love watching the bubbling, glowing lava rise up, explode, and spread everywhere!

The volcano was loads of fun, but now they're eager for something new.

"Mum! Mum! Can we do another experiment? Please? Can you give us some ideas?" Cassie asks.

Mum smiles. "Experiments? Hmm, but we're going to Sydney Harbour soon. Dad has a lovely surprise planned for you both."

"Ooh, I love surprises!" Caleb says, bouncing on his toes.

Both children are thrilled about the surprise, but the excitement of experiments is hard to resist.

"Aww, just one more experiment, Mum? Please? We can do it quickly!" Cassie pleads.

"I'm going to make some snacks for our trip," Mum says. "Why don't you help me?"

Cassie is a bit disappointed, but baking does sound fun. "Okay... can we bake chocolate cake?"

Caleb's eyes go wide. "Chocolate cake! Yes!"

"Alright," Mum laughs. "Let's bake chocolate cake!"

As they gather ingredients, Mum shares her dilemma. "I can't decide—should we make a sponge cake or a mud cake? Do you have a preference?"

Uh-oh. Cassie loves sponge cake, but Caleb loves mud cake!

"Why do you like sponge cake more, Cassie?" Mum asks.

Cassie thinks hard. "I can't really explain it. I just like how it feels—soft and yummy in my tummy!"

Mum asks Caleb the same question. He scrunches up his face, thinking. "Mud cake is... creamy!"

"I have a brilliant idea!" Mum exclaims. "What if we put on our scientist hats and do a cake experiment? We'll make both cakes and discover the differences ourselves!"

Cassie and Caleb do a victory dance. "Yes! Yes!" they cheer.

"Let's gather ingredients," says Mum. "What do we need?"

"Chocolate!" Cassie grins from ear to ear.

Mum chuckles. "Yes, of course—chocolate!"

"Sugar!" Caleb shouts.

"Flour... butter..." Cassie adds, then pauses. What else?

Can you think of any ingredients they might be missing?

"Well done, you two!" Mum says. "We'll also need eggs and baking soda. And for the mud cake, there's one special extra ingredient—milk."

Cassie's curiosity sparks. "Wait—so we need exactly the same ingredients for both cakes, except mud cake has milk?"

"I love how you're paying attention!" Mum says. "That's right. But here's the really interesting part—it's not just *what* ingredients we use, but *how much* of each."

"So both cakes are made of the same stuff, just in different amounts?" Cassie thinks aloud.

"Exactly! Mud cakes use more butter and fewer eggs, which makes them dense and rich—just like Caleb said, creamy! Eggs help cakes rise and become light and fluffy. That's why sponge cakes have more eggs and less butter. And the milk in mud cake makes it even more moist."

As they mix ingredients, Cassie's brain is buzzing with questions. "Mum, what does 'dense' actually mean? How can I tell if something is denser than something else?"

"Brilliant question!" Mum's eyes light up. "Density tells us how heavy something is for its size. Here—let's do a quick experiment!"

Mum takes two identical glasses. She fills one with water and one with Cassie's thick banana smoothie.

"Which do you think will be heavier?" Mum asks.

Cassie thinks carefully. "The smoothie?"

"Why don't you test it on the kitchen scale?"

Cassie measures both glasses. Yes! The smoothie glass is heavier!

"Same size glasses, different weights," Mum explains. "The smoothie is denser—it has more 'stuff' packed into the same space."

Now Cassie can't stop measuring things! She discovers butter is denser than milk, and sugar is denser than flour. 

"This is so much fun!" Cassie exclaims. "I wonder if I can learn to guess which things are denser, just by looking at them!"

What do you think? Could you develop a sense for density too?

*DING!* goes the oven.

"Yum yum, when can we eat it, Mum?" Caleb asks, rubbing his tummy.

Cassie giggles. "Hey, that rhymes!"

The cakes are ready! Everyone takes a slice of each. Cassie pays extra attention to how each cake feels on her tongue. The sponge cake is light and airy. The mud cake is rich and heavy. Now she understands why!

What an *egg-cellent* experiment!

### Chapter 2: Beautiful Fishes

"When are we going to the harbour, Mum?" Caleb asks.

In fact, he's asked about fifty times in the last hour!

"Alright, everyone—time to get ready! We're heading to the harbour!" Mum announces.

Cassie puts on her detective hat. She's determined to figure out Dad's surprise! She's been to Sydney Harbour before and absolutely loves the bridge walk. Watching the sunset over the water is one of her favourite things. But this is supposed to be something *new*...

Neither Mum nor Dad will give any clues. Tough luck, Detective Cassie!

The children hop into their car seats. "All set? Ready to go?" Mum asks.

"YES!" Cassie and Caleb shout together.

"Surprise, here we come! Oui, oui, oui!" Cassie calls out cheekily.

Dad loads the esky into the car. Then Mum loads something interesting—a long stick, coloured black and red.

"What's that stick thing, Mum?" Caleb asks.

"It's called a fishing rod!"

Cassie gasps. "Fishing! Are we going FISHING? Is that our surprise?"

"Oops!" Dad laughs. "Looks like Mum let the cat out of the bag!"

Cassie feels like the world's greatest detective—like Sherlock Holmes himself!

"Are we there yet?" Caleb asks almost immediately.

Cassie rolls her eyes. "We just started driving!"

"How do we fish, Daddy?" Cassie asks. She wants to be prepared.

"It might be easier to show you when we get there," Dad says, "but let me explain some important rules first."

"Rule Number One: Slip, Slop, Slap!"

Dad starts singing the classic Australian sun-safety song, and everyone joins in:

*"Slip, Slop, Slap!*  
*It sounds like a breeze when you say it like that!*  
*Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen, and slap on a hat!*  
*Slip, Slop, Slap!"*

"Rule Number Two," Dad continues, "is to be kind to the fish and our environment. We'll safely release any fish we catch. We're just saying hello to them! Deal?"

"Yes, sir!" Cassie and Caleb agree.

Dad explains how fishing works: "We put fish food called 'bait' on a hook attached to the fishing rod. We lower it into the water. When a fish comes to grab the bait, it gets caught on the hook. Then we gently reel it in!"

"We'll take photos, learn about each fish, and make a nature journal," Mum adds. "How does that sound?"

"Can we play with the fishes?" Caleb asks hopefully.

"Fish can't live without water, Caleb," Cassie says seriously.

"If you're lucky, some fish might swim close by," Mum says. "Maybe you can play a game of 'spot me if you can!'"

Cassie has been thinking. "But wait—how do fish breathe underwater? Why can't they live on land like us?"

Are you wondering the same thing?

"Fish have special organs called gills," Mum explains. "When water flows through the gills, tiny tissues inside absorb oxygen from the water and send it into the fish's blood. But gills only work with water—they can't get oxygen from air."

"So that's why fish have to stay in water!" Cassie says, amazed.

"Here's something fascinating," Mum adds. "There's a rare group called 'air-breathing fishes.' They have an extra organ that lets them breathe air for short periods! One type is called the lungfish—they actually have lungs like us!"

"Can we see them today?" Caleb asks excitedly.

"I'm sorry, buddy—lungfish live in Queensland, quite far from here. But isn't it amazing that they exist?"

"Speaking of fascinating creatures," Dad says, "there's a brilliant scientist named Professor Emma Johnston who studies harbour life right here in Sydney. She's discovered incredible things about how fish and other sea creatures survive—even in busy harbours like the one we're visiting!"

"A real scientist who studies our harbour?" Cassie's eyes go wide.

"She leads big teams of researchers who protect marine life," Mum explains. "Maybe we'll see some scientists at work today!"

"I love watching fish swim," Caleb says dreamily. "They wiggle their little tails so beautifully."

"Can you tell us how fish swim, Daddy?" Cassie asks.

"Fish have special organs called fins—flat, flexible parts around their body that help them move. There are six different types of fins! They help fish go up, down, left, right, and spin all around."

"Six fins! I'm learning to swim with just my arms and legs," Cassie says.

"Soon your swim teacher will give you flippers—artificial fins made of plastic! They work like a fish's caudal fin."

"Caudal? What's caudal?" Cassie giggles at the funny word.

Dad lists all six fin names: dorsal, pectoral, adipose, caudal, anal, and pelvic.

"Those names are tongue-twisters!" Cassie laughs.

"I want to watch really carefully how fish use their fins," Caleb says.

"That's the spirit!" Dad says proudly.

### Chapter 3: Buoyancy Quest

Dad parks the car. They've arrived at Sydney Harbour!

The view takes Cassie's breath away. The Opera House gleams on one side, Luna Park's smiling face beams from the other. Beautiful yachts and catamarans dot the sparkling blue water.

"Wait," Caleb says, pointing at a sailboat. "How are those boats swimming? They don't have fins!"

"Great observation!" Mum says. "Boats aren't swimming—they're *floating*! When you swim, you move through the water. When something floats, part of it sits in the water and part sits above."

"But how does floating work?" Cassie asks.

"Excellent question! Remember when we learned about gravity at Cronulla Beach?"

"Gravity pulls everything down!" the children cheer, jumping twice for fun. "It makes jumping brilliant!"

*(If you want to learn all about gravity with Cassie, check out "Curious Cassie's Beach Ride Quest: A Celebration of Sir Isaac Newton's Discoveries!")*

"When a boat sits on water," Mum continues, "gravity tries to pull it down to the bottom. But there's another force working against gravity—it's called **buoyancy**. Buoyancy pushes things UP!"

"So it's like a battle?" Cassie asks, eyes wide.

"Exactly! Gravity pulls down, buoyancy pushes up. If gravity wins, the object sinks. If buoyancy wins, it floats!"

"What decides who wins?" Caleb asks.

"The strength of buoyancy depends on how much water an object pushes out of the way. Let me show you!"

Mum takes out a large container and fills it with water, right up to the brim. She holds up Cassie's empty juice bottle.

"Is this bottle heavy or light?"

"Very light!" both children say.

Mum drops the bottle in. *SPLASH!* Some water spills over the edge, but the bottle floats!

"See how the bottle pushed some water out? That water creates the buoyant force. Because this bottle is so light, gravity isn't pulling very hard. The buoyancy wins—so it floats!"

"Can I try something?" Cassie asks.

She takes the bottle out and fills it with water. Now it's much heavier. She drops it in and... down it goes. It sinks!

"The bottle pushed aside the same amount of water as before," Mum explains, "so the buoyancy is the same. But now gravity is much stronger because the bottle is heavier. Gravity wins—it sinks!"

Cassie and Caleb experiment over and over. Empty bottle? Floats! Full bottle? Sinks! Every single time!

"I can do this at home in the bathtub!" Cassie exclaims.

Just then, an enormous ship approaches the wharf. The crew throws a massive anchor overboard. *SPLASH!* It sinks straight to the bottom.

Cassie watches thoughtfully. "Mum, I don't understand. That ship is HUGE—way heavier than the anchor. So why did the anchor sink while the ship floats?"

"That's exactly the right question to ask! Here's the secret: the bottom of a ship is called the **hull**, and it's designed to be hollow inside—like a giant bowl. When the ship sits on the water, that bowl shape pushes aside an enormous amount of water. Much, much more than the anchor does!"

"So the ship creates way more buoyancy!" Cassie realises.

"Precisely! The anchor is solid metal—it pushes aside only a tiny bit of water. Gravity wins easily. But the ship's clever design creates enough buoyancy to beat gravity!"

"Ships are like floating bowls!" Caleb says.

"Would you like to hear a funny story about how people discovered all this?" Mum asks.

"Yes, please!"

"Long ago in ancient Greece, there was a brilliant man named Archimedes. His king asked him to find out if the royal crown was made of pure gold or if the crown-maker had secretly replaced some gold with cheaper metal."

"How could he figure that out?" Cassie asks.

"Archimedes thought and thought, but couldn't solve it. Then one day, he stepped into a full bathtub. Water sloshed over the sides—and suddenly, he had an idea! He realised he could measure how much water different objects push aside. If the crown was pure gold, it would push aside the same amount of water as an equal weight of pure gold!"

"Did his idea work?" Caleb asks.

"It did! And here's the funny part—Archimedes was SO excited that he leaped out of the bath and ran through the streets shouting 'EUREKA! EUREKA!'—which means 'I found it!' in Greek!"

"Wait—" Cassie starts giggling. "Did he forget to get dressed first?"

"The story says he ran out completely naked!"

Cassie and Caleb burst out laughing. Soon they're running around shouting "EUREKA! EUREKA!" (fully clothed, thankfully).

"Remember density from our cake experiment?" Mum asks once they've settled down. "Density affects buoyancy too! Denser liquids create stronger buoyant forces. That's why it's easier to float in the ocean than in a swimming pool—salt water is denser than fresh water!"

"Can we test that at home?" Cassie asks.

"Absolutely! You could try floating objects in plain water, then in very salty water, and see what happens."

Caleb spots a red balloon drifting across the sky. "Look! That balloon is floating in the air!"

"That's buoyancy too!" Dad says.

Cassie is eager to explain what she's learned. "The balloon is filled with special light gas, so gravity can't pull very hard. The air around it creates a buoyant force pushing up. Buoyancy wins—the balloon floats!"

Everyone claps for Cassie's explanation.

"Some fish use buoyancy in a clever way," Mum adds. "Heavy fish would normally sink, but many have a special organ called a **swim bladder**—it's like a tiny balloon inside their body! By filling it with air or letting air out, they can float at whatever depth they want."

"Fish have balloons inside them?!" Caleb is amazed.

"Nature is full of incredible designs," Mum says. "That's what makes studying it so exciting—and why scientists like Professor Emma Johnston dedicate their lives to understanding ocean creatures!"

# Chapter 4: Rock Pool Treasures
*(Insert between "Buoyancy Quest" and "Marine Biology Champions" — renumber final chapter to Chapter 5)*

---

While Dad sets up the fishing rods, Mum notices something special along the harbour's edge.

"Children, come look at this!" she calls, crouching near some large rocks by the water.

Cassie and Caleb scramble over. Between the rocks, there's a small pool of water—like a tiny ocean trapped in stone!

"It's a rock pool!" Mum says. "When the tide goes out, seawater gets left behind in these little rocky bowls. They become like miniature worlds, full of creatures!"

Cassie peers in carefully. At first, she only sees water and pebbles. But then—

"Mum! Something moved!"

A tiny crab scuttles sideways across the bottom of the pool, tucking itself under a ledge.

"I see it! I see it!" Caleb whispers excitedly.

"Rock pools are wonderful places to observe sea creatures," Mum says softly. "But remember—we look with our eyes, not our hands. These are the animals' homes, and we're just visitors."

Cassie nods seriously. She's a scientist now, and scientists respect nature.

"Why did the crab walk sideways?" Caleb asks, trying to copy the crab's funny walk.

"Great observation!" Dad says, joining them. "Crabs have a wide, flat body shape. Their legs are attached at the sides, which makes it easier and faster for them to scuttle sideways. It's how they're built!"

"Everything about an animal's body helps it survive," Mum adds. "That's called **adaptation**. Over a very, very long time, animals develop special features that help them live in their environment."

Cassie spots something else—a beautiful purple sea star clinging to the rock, just below the water's surface.

"Look! A starfish!"

"Scientists actually call them 'sea stars' now," Mum says, "because they're not really fish at all! Fish have backbones inside their bodies, but sea stars don't. They're called **invertebrates**—animals without backbones."

"No backbone? But how do they hold their shape?" Cassie is puzzled.

"Sea stars have a special trick. Their bodies are supported by seawater! They pump water through their bodies to stay firm and to move around. See those tiny tube feet underneath?"

Cassie looks closely. The sea star's underside has rows of teeny-tiny tubes, like little fingers.

"Each tube foot works like a tiny suction cup," Mum explains. "The sea star fills them with water to grip the rocks. That's how it holds on tight, even when big waves crash!"

"Water power!" Caleb says, impressed.

"Here's something amazing," Dad adds. "If a sea star loses one of its arms, it can grow a new one! Some sea stars can even grow a whole new body from just one arm!"

Cassie's jaw drops. "That's like a superpower!"

"Nature is full of superpowers," Mum smiles.

Caleb has wandered to the other side of the rock pool. "What are THESE squishy things?" he asks, pointing at some blob-like lumps stuck to the rock. They look like little mounds of jelly.

"Those are sea anemones!" Mum says. "Right now the tide is low, so they've pulled in their tentacles to stay moist. But when the water covers them again, they'll open up like beautiful underwater flowers!"

"Do they sting?" Cassie asks.

"They can! Anemones have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to catch small prey that float by. But there's one fish that doesn't get stung—do you know which one?"

Cassie thinks hard. Then her face lights up. "Clownfish! Like in the movies!"

"Exactly! Clownfish have a special slimy coating on their skin that protects them from the stings. They live right inside the anemone's tentacles where predators can't reach them. And in return, the clownfish helps keep the anemone clean!"

"So they help each other?" Cassie asks.

"That's right. It's called a **symbiotic relationship**—when two different creatures help each other survive. The ocean is full of partnerships like this!"

Can you think of any other animal partnerships?

Cassie notices something odd. Some of the rocks seem to be moving! No wait—those aren't rocks at all...

"Mum, that rock has LEGS!"

Mum laughs. "That's a hermit crab! They don't grow their own shells, so they find empty snail shells to live in. As they grow bigger, they have to find bigger shells to move into—like moving to a new house!"

"Shell shopping!" Caleb giggles.

"And look at the colour of that one," Dad points to a small crab hiding near some green seaweed. "See how it's greenish-brown? That's **camouflage**. Its colour helps it blend in so predators can't spot it easily."

Cassie scans the pool more carefully now. Once she knows to look for camouflage, she spots creatures everywhere! A tiny fish the colour of sand. A shrimp that's nearly see-through. A snail with a shell that looks just like the pebbles around it.

"It's like a hidden picture puzzle!" she exclaims.

"Scientists who study harbours—like Professor Emma Johnston—have discovered that rock pools are like tiny ecosystems," Mum says. "An **ecosystem** is a community where all the living things depend on each other."

"What do you mean?" Cassie asks.

"Well, think about it. The tiny algae and seaweed grow on the rocks. Little snails eat the algae. Crabs eat the snails. Bigger fish might eat the crabs. And when any creature dies, it breaks down and becomes food for the algae to grow. Everything is connected in a circle!"

Cassie gazes at the little pool with new eyes. It's not just a puddle—it's a whole world with its own food chain, its own neighbourhoods, its own dramas!

"Professor Johnston's research showed that even in busy harbours, these little ecosystems can survive and adapt," Dad adds. "She proved that marine life is tougher than people thought—but it still needs our help to stay healthy."

"That's why we never leave rubbish near the water," Mum says. "And why we look but don't touch the rock pool creatures. Every animal here has an important job!"

Caleb has been very quiet, watching something intently. "Mum," he whispers. "The anemone is doing something!"

Everyone gathers around. A small wave has just washed over the rock pool, bringing fresh seawater. And slowly, magically, the anemone begins to open. Soft tentacles unfurl like delicate petals, swaying gently in the water.

"Ohhhh," Cassie breathes. "It's so beautiful."

For a moment, the whole family is silent, watching the little anemone bloom.

"Thank you for showing us your home," Caleb whispers to the rock pool.

Mum squeezes his hand. "That's the perfect thing to say, sweetheart."

As they head back to their fishing spot, Cassie's mind is buzzing. Crabs that walk sideways. Sea stars with water-powered feet. Anemones that partner with clownfish. Hermit crabs that go house-hunting. So many incredible adaptations, all in one tiny pool!

"Mum," she says thoughtfully, "I used to think the harbour was just water and boats. But there's so much MORE living here!"

"That's exactly what scientists want people to understand," Mum replies. "When we know about the amazing creatures sharing our world, we want to protect them."

Cassie nods firmly. She's going to add a whole rock pool section to her nature journal. Maybe she'll even draw the anemone opening up, like an underwater flower greeting the waves.

### Science Words We Learned:

- **Adaptation**: Special features that help an animal survive in its environment
- **Invertebrate**: An animal without a backbone
- **Camouflage**: Colours or patterns that help an animal blend in and hide
- **Symbiotic relationship**: When two different creatures help each other survive
- **Ecosystem**: A community where all living things depend on each other

### Rock Pool Experiment to Try!

**Create a Mini Ecosystem Jar** (with adult supervision)

You'll need: A large glass jar, pond water or aged tap water, small aquatic plants from a pet shop, a few small pond snails

1. Add a layer of clean pebbles to the jar
2. Fill with water and let it settle
3. Add the plants and snails
4. Place in indirect sunlight

Watch your mini ecosystem over several weeks! The plants produce oxygen for the snails, and the snails help keep the plants clean. You've created your own symbiotic relationship!

*(Always release creatures back where you found them, and never take animals from rock pools.)*

### Chapter 5: Marine Biology Champions

"This has been the best day ever!" Cassie says. "I've learned about cakes and density, fish and fins, floating and buoyancy, boats and balloons! What was YOUR favourite thing, Caleb?"

Caleb jumps up and shouts, "EUREKA! EUREKA!"

Everyone laughs.

Dad sets up the fishing rods, carefully putting bait on each hook. He hands one to Cassie and one to Caleb.

"Now we wait patiently for the fish to come," Dad says.

Cassie gets her camera ready. Caleb opens his drawing notebook and takes out his crayons. They're going to make the best nature journal ever!

Suddenly, something tugs Caleb's rod!

"Daddy! Daddy! I think I got a fish!"

Dad hurries over to help. Together, they gently reel in... a Mulloway fish!

"Wonderful catch!" Dad points out all six fins, the gills on each side, and the fish's big, curious eyes.

"Does the Mulloway have a swim bladder?" Cassie asks.

Mum checks on her phone. "Yes! Mulloway fish definitely have swim bladders."

Caleb beams with pride. Carefully, with Dad's help, he releases the fish back into the harbour. "Bye-bye, fish! Thanks for saying hello!"

Now Cassie's rod is tugging!

Dad helps her reel in a beautiful Mullet fish.

"Hello, little Mullet!" Cassie says softly. They take photos and sketch quickly before releasing her back to the water.

"Mullet fish are quite cheeky," Mum says. "They're famous for jumping out of the water!"

"Jumping? How can fish jump in water?" Cassie asks.

"Same way you jump on land—they push themselves upward using strong muscles! Mullet jump partly to grab oxygen from the air. Remember how some fish can breathe air briefly? Mullet are one of them!"

"My fish can breathe air AND has strong jumping muscles!" Cassie grins.

As they pack up, Caleb spots something floating nearby. "Mum, look—a plastic bag!"

Mum's smile fades. "Oh no. This is terrible for the fish and all the harbour creatures."

She uses Caleb's fishing rod to scoop up the bag and puts it in a nearby bin.

"Good job, Mum!" says Dad.

"Plastic in the ocean is one of the biggest problems marine scientists are trying to solve," Mum explains. "Every piece of rubbish we keep out of the water helps protect sea life."

Walking back toward the car, the family notices a group of people with snorkelling gear heading toward the water.

Dad chats with them briefly, then returns looking impressed.

"Guess what? Those are marine biologists from the University of Sydney! They study the creatures living in this very harbour—just like Professor Emma Johnston, who I mentioned earlier!"

"What does Professor Johnston do?" Cassie asks.

"She's one of Australia's most important marine scientists," Dad explains. "She studies how sea creatures survive and adapt—even in busy harbours like this one, where there are boats, buildings, and pollution. She's discovered that marine life can be incredibly resilient!"

"She also leads Science & Technology Australia," Mum adds, "which means she helps ALL kinds of scientists across the country do their important work. And she teaches young people that they can become scientists too—just by staying curious and asking questions, like you two do!"

Cassie feels a warm glow inside. "So asking questions is how scientists start?"

"Exactly," Mum says. "Every great discovery begins with someone asking 'why?' or 'how?'—just like you did today!"

"Maybe I'll be a marine biologist when I grow up," Cassie says thoughtfully. "I could study fish and help keep them safe."

"Me too!" Caleb agrees. "EUREKA!"

On the drive home, Cassie and Caleb start planning their nature journal. They have so much to write about: density and cakes, gills and fins, gravity and buoyancy, and the wonderful harbour creatures they met today.

"Thank you for the best surprise ever," Cassie tells her parents.

Dad smiles in the rearview mirror. "The real surprise is how much you both taught US today."

And that night, after eating the last slices of sponge cake AND mud cake, Cassie fell asleep dreaming of fish with tiny balloon swim bladders, floating through a sea of science and wonder.
