# Curious Cassie's Beach Ride Quest
## A Celebration of Isaac Newton's Discoveries

## Synopsis

Cassie is a curious six-year-old kid who loves thinking and asking interesting questions. Her mum is calling upon Cassie and Caleb (Cassie's three-year-old brother) to get ready as they are heading to Cronulla Beach for an adventurous day. 

Thinking about "moving," Cassie wonders why people can move but not trees. Her mum explains the mechanism of movement and tells them a fun fact about the "Walking Palm"—a special tree that can actually move by growing new roots toward sunshine. As they discuss how the Walking Palm moves, Cassie's curiosity shifts to watching sand and rain fall to the ground. She wonders why everything falls down. Mum helps her feel gravity through bunny hops, and Cassie discovers that she has to WORK to jump up, but gravity brings her down for free!

In the car, Caleb is impatient and keeps interrupting to find out when they will arrive at the beach. Mum takes Caleb's impatience as an opportunity to explain the concepts of distance, time, and speed using fun references to their walks to the park. She explains kilometers as a unit of distance and speed as how many kilometers you travel in a certain time. Curious Cassie does skip counting to calculate both the distance (5 round trips to the park) and the estimated time (10 minutes) to calm Caleb down.

Cassie notices that all the roadside trees and bushes appear to be running backward when she is the one moving. Mum uses this observation to explain relative motion—how movement looks different depending on where you're watching from. She then encourages the kids to do an experiment, tossing a ball up in the air in the moving car. The kids are thrilled to discover that the ball lands ahead, behind, or straight in their lap depending on what the car does after the ball is thrown. This is because the ball was already moving with them!

At the beach, Cassie discovers Newton's Third Law when she notices that pushing the sand makes the sand push back. As the family builds sandcastles and splashes in the waves, they experience push and push-back everywhere. When a rainbow appears in the sea spray, Mum shares Newton's discovery that white light contains all the hidden colors of the rainbow. 

Throughout the adventure, Mum tells the children about Sir Isaac Newton, who figured out all these amazing things by staying curious and thinking hard. She shares Newton's own words: "If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results," and Einstein's famous quote about being "passionately curious." Cassie is inspired to keep asking questions, knowing that curiosity is the key to discovery—just like Isaac Newton!
